## Description
For some spacers, sighting these strange, spectral creatures on a spaceborne journey is a portent of a change in fortune. A few even profess to divine meaning from their elaborate, luminous dance, as people of old would interpret omens by studying the flight of birds. Others refer to the wisps as corpse lights, believing they are the spirits of ancient beings cursed to linger forever within the cold void between stars. Less superstitious spacers swear on various methods of “shooing” wisps away—everything from cycling the engines to cutting power entirely for a minute or so and allowing the creatures to move on

## Variants
### Variant: Wisp Congregation
**Rank: ** Dangerous: (2)

In the depths of space where light and warmth are commodities, ember wisps congregate around sources of energy—such as the engine wake of a starship. Their dazzling display of light and motion is an alluring sight for an isolated spacer. But they also pose a potential threat; they can envelop the hull of a vessel, leeching the starship of precious energy.

### Quest Starter
