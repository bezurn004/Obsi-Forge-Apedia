# [[_INDEX|Index]] - [[_GNPC_Foes-Encounters|Foes and Encounters]]: Denizens Summary
This section includes a variety of NPCs to help inspire some of the foes, forces, and creatures you may encounter in your adventures. Use what fits your version of the Forge, keeping in mind the choices you made when you defined the truths of the setting. If your campaign is gritty and grounded, ignore any fantastical NPCs. If you want to boost the strange aspects of the Forge, you can emphasize the supernatural or monstrous.

For full details on NPCs and their mechanics, see Chapter 4 - [[_GNPC_Foes-Encounters|Foes and Encounters]]

## General Disposition
_The disposition of the denizen is a categorization based on their interaction toward humanity in general._
- **Kind:** Will seek positive interactions with those they meet, so long as they do not pose a threat to their nature or kin.
- **Neutral:**  Do not concern themselves in the going on of other creatures. Protect themselves and  kin from harm or overt actions.
- **Natural:** Will seek prey in their domain, but will not overtly kill for sport or malice.
- **Aggressive:** Seeks prey when needed and will exert control or destroy any lifeforms on a whim per their nature.
