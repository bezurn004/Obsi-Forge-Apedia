## Description
The chiton are not native to any single planet, and are adaptable to most environments. Some suggest they are an ancient precursor bioweapon seeded across the galaxy. The larva of the telepathic queen can lay dormant for thousands of years, emerging only when its sleep is disturbed by the mental energies of intelligent life. An awoken queen quickly metamorphoses into its adult form and lays its first clutch of eggs. Soon after, newly-hatched drones set out to expand the nest and feed their ravenous progenitor

## Variants
### Variant: Chiton Drone Pack
**Rank: ** Formidable (3)

Chiton drones rarely operate independently. Instead, they hunt and attack in packs under the telepathic control of their queen. 

### Variant: Chiton Queen
**Rank: ** Extreme (4)

The chiton queen is a massive creature with segmented pincers, an armored carapace, and a bulging, egg-carrying abdomen. From the depths of the nest, it commands its drones telepathically. This psychic communication is so powerful it can even breach human consciousness, troubling dreams and waking hallucinations might be the harbinger of a chiton invasion.

### Quest Starter
> At a remote facility, researchers are studying a newly-discovered chiton queen larva. The immature queen is held in frozen stasis, but something might have gone wrong. The return of a transport ship ferrying supplies to the researchers is weeks overdue. What is your connection to the facility or to the faction overseeing it? ^QuestStarter
