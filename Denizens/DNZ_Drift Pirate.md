## Description
Drifts provide the means of interstellar travel across the Forge–but also offer myriad dangers for spacers. Chief among those threats are drift pirates: reavers and thieves who prowl eidolon passages and anchorages to seize ships and cargo for their own. These pirates often live short, brutal lives, or survive long enough to see their near-constant exposure to drift energies and unshielded eidolon drives manifest as strange mutations. Despite that, most would not trade their chosen path for one of comfort or safety

## Variants
### Variant: Pirate Boarding Party
**Rank: ** Formidable: (3)

After reeling in a disabled ship, drift pirates breach the hull and swarm the corridors. They target critical systems and compartments to seize the ship and its cargo for their flotilla

### Variant: Pirate Cutlass (Vehicle)
**Rank: ** Formidable: (3)

Drift pirates often strip down commandeered vessels, taking what they need to refit or augment their own ships. What’s left is discarded or sold on the black market. A typical pirate cutlass is a haphazard collection of parts, splashed with the colors and sigils of their commanders, built for speed and brutish power. The imposing sight of one of these fierce vessels is enough to send a chill through the heart of even the boldest spacer.

### Quest Starter
> A drift pirate captain seizes an experimental new e-drive, and uses it to stalk ships with deadly efficiency. Who created this new drive, and what are they willing to pay to get it back?
