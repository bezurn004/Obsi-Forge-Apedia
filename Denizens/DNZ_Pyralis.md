## Description
On scorching worlds of fire and ash, only the most resilient survive. The pyralis is a cunning predator that spends most of its life gliding among boiling ash clouds, using its sensitive, smoke-piercing vision to spot unwary prey.

This beast’s form is an intimidating fusion of insect, crustacean and hawk. Its outer shell and plated wings protect it from heat and flame, but it is pitted and scarred by innumerable collisions with airborne volcanic fragments. Its most fearsome aspect is a segmented tail, which it uses to deliver a powerful, paralyzing toxin to its unfortunate prey.

They are asexual and solitary creatures, and mark the bounds of their hunting grounds with intricate cairns built from the bones of their victims. If a rival pyralis passes overhead, the sight of that marker is forewarning that they are straying into another’s domain.

## Variants
### Variant: Pyralis Youngling
**Rank: ** Dangerous: (2)

The carapace of a dying pyralis cracks and falls away to reveal a single, stone-like egg. This offspring, slowly nurtured by the heat of the fiery landscape, finally emerges after several months. Smaller than its progenitor but no less fierce, the youngling immediately takes flight and goes on the hunt

### Quest Starter
> A critically damaged spaceship is stranded amid the hellscape of a furnace world. You are sworn to rescue the crew of this ill-fated vessel, but the frequent ash storms prevent vehicular operations—you’ll need to make the perilous journey on foot. To make matters worse, the wreck is within the territory of a particularly aggressive and powerful pyralis. How will you survive the journey across its hunting grounds? ^QuestStarter
