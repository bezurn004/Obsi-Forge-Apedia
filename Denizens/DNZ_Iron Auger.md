## Description
Augers are an ancient precursor technology. These machines fuel their operation through an incessant hunger for minerals and metals, boring into asteroids, scouring small airless planetoids, even grappling onto space stations and starships.

A few bold fortune hunters have taken up auger hunting as a trade, setting out in harpoon-equipped starships to snare the great machines. The metals and technology of a dismantled auger can fetch a hefty price, but even the most skilled hunters are likely to see their ship made fodder for a machine’s hunger

## Variants
### Variant: Machine Mites
**Rank: ** Dangerous: (2)

Iron augers self-replicate by producing swarms of tiny machine spawn. When those offspring come within range of a source of minerals or metals, they latch onto it and begin consuming the energy-giving material. Experienced spacers make a close inspection of their ship when pulling into port; a horde of undetected machine mites can eventually strip a craft of its outer hull.

### Variant: Planet Eater
**Rank: ** Epic: (5)

Over time, an iron auger grows in size and power as it greedily processes scavenged materials and reconstructs its own form. Some spacers tell stories of an auger so titanic that it devours entire worlds to feed the furnaces of its mighty engines

### Quest Starter
> As a massive auger approaches an orbital station under your protection, you face a difficult choice. Do you find a way to evacuate and save who you can, or attempt to bring down the mighty machine? ^QuestStarter
