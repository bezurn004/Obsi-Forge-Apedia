# [[_Denizen Index|Denizens Summary]]: Firestorm Trooper
## Components
**Rank: ** Formidable (3)

| Features | Drives | Tactics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raiders with scarred flesh and polished armor | Conquer the Forge | Strike sudden and swift |
| Powered exosuits and distinctive helms | Reap the resources owed them | Attack flanks and weak points from above |
| Roaring jetpacks and fluttering banners | Venerate their leaders, creed, or gods | Cull the weak, recruit the strong |

## Description
The Forge is largely wild, uncharted territory, but armored firestorm troopers seek to plunder the whole of it in the name of their clans, their creed, or their inscrutable gods.

Striking with the speed and strength of a hurricane, they raid worlds and stations for resources and conscripts, leaving settlements in ruins. So deadly and effective are their tactics, that it’s often said if these zealots could only stop warring amongst themselves, their banners would fly across the breadth of the Forge

## Variants
### Variant: Firestorm Raiding Team
**Rank: ** Extreme: (4)

Feared throughout the Forge for their brutal tactics and destructive weaponry, coordinated teams of firestorm troopers descend upon settlements and stations in powered exosuits, flying the banners of their orders amid the smoke and flames of the devastation.

### Variant: Firestorm Dropship (Vehicle)
**Rank: ** Dangerous: (2)

The bulky, ironclad dropships favored by firestorm clans are designed for a single purpose: deliver an overwhelming force of armored troopers into the fight

### Quest Starter
> Despite conflicting creeds, several firestorm clans unite beneath the banner of Torren the Purifier to invade the Terminus. Their next target is a world at the nexus of trade lanes. What is this planet, and why is it important to you?
