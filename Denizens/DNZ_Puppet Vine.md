## Description
A puppet vine is a parasitic, plant-like entity. It is usually encountered as thorny, fleshy tendrils sprouting from the desiccated corpse of an unwilling host, a creature or careless explorer. That victim, skin shriveled tight against their bones, mouth agape in a silent scream, is made a horrific marionette as the vine takes control of their motor functions to send them shambling about in search of new hosts.

When the vine encounters a potential victim, it lashes out, entangling them, cutting into their flesh with hollow thorns. It uses those thorns to implant microscopic seeds. After a few hours, the seeds mature and sprout. Unless stopped, the fast-growing tendrils course greedily through the victim’s body, consuming the fluids within. Then, the vines burst forth to begin the cycle anew.

## Variants
### Variant: Flowering Puppet Vine
**Rank: ** Formidable: (3)

After a host is reduced to decaying, mummified flesh and cracked bones, the puppet vine remains anchored to the now-immobile corpse. In this final stage of its life-cycle, the vines sprout alluring crimson flowers to attract unwary victims.

### Quest Starter
> At a remote settlement, a settler is attacked by a puppet vine and infected. The outpost’s fast-thinking healer puts the victim in stasis, stopping, for now, the sprouting and spread of the vines. But time is of the essence. They need someone to transport the stasis pod and its unfortunate occupant to a distant facility for treatment, and your ship is the only one currently planetside. What do they offer to gain your help in this risky mission? ^QuestStarter
