## Description
Scrap bandits roam the fringes of settled sectors, preying on planetside outposts. They survive by seizing provisions, resources, and equipment from those places. Because these raiders tend to revisit fruitful settlements, they do what they can to avoid razing them to the ground or leaving the settlers with less than they need to survive. “Never let a field go fallow,” is a common scrap bandit expression.

## Variants
### Variant: Hover Prowsers
**Rank: ** Dangerous: (3)

Teams of bandits, riding jerry-built hoverbikes and skiffs, are the vanguard for planetside raids. They scout settlement defenses, ride as escort for the clan’s war rig, and create chaos to overrun defenders

### Variant: War Rig (Vehicle)
**Rank: ** Extreme: (4)

At the onset of a raid, a scrap bandit clan’s war rig is deployed by a heavy transport ship beyond a settlement’s defenses. These mobile fortresses vary in form and function—some use hover tech, others thunder across the landscape on wheels or treads, a few trudge along on articulated metal legs. All are heavily armored, bristling with weapons, and fiercely defended by the bandits. The mere sight of the rig as it approaches is often enough for a settlement to surrender and agree to any demand.

### Quest Starter
> In a far-flung sector, a titanic creature threatens a key planetside settlement. The only possible defense against this beast is the mighty war rig belonging to a clan of scrap bandits. But can you convince the bandits to risk their rig to protect the settlers? If so, what will they demand in return? ^QuestStarter
