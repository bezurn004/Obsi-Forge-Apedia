## Full Description
Use this move when you make a careful search or do fact-finding. What you uncover may reveal the best path forward, or introduce new twists and turns in your quest.

But if you’re spending time searching, investigating, analyzing, interrogating, especially related to a quest, that’s when you Gather Information. Think of it this way: Gather Information is focused on story, tending to introduce new complications. Those other moves are focused on situations. Use the move most appropriate to the circumstances and your intent.

> [!quote]- Narrative example
> You are sworn to capture an infamous fugitive who is rumored to be hiding out at an outpost. You envision making discreet inquiries among the locals, and Gather Information to see what you learn.
