## Full Description
When you Swear an Iron Vow, the quest is given a challenge rank and managed through a progress track [[Progress Track]]. Then, as you strive to complete your quest, you face and overcome challenges. Some of these challenges arise naturally out of the fiction of your situation. Others represent narrative twists introduced when you interpret the result of a move or when you Ask the Oracle for inspiration. When you reach these turning points and forge ahead in your vow, make this move and mark progress on the related quest. 

The move includes a list of milestone triggers, but there is flexibility in how you interpret accomplishments and events in your story. The pace of your quests is largely defined by what you set as milestones. They should be meaningful to your character and your vow, requiring effort and sacrifice. An insignificant discovery or effortless success is probably not a milestone. 

If you’re not sure if something is worthy of a milestone, trust your instincts and the type of play experience you want to create. If you’re playing co-op or guided, talk it out at the table. If you are in doubt, err on the side of success; Reach a Milestone and play to see what happens next. 

If you find your story moving to a resolution well ahead of your progress track, envision some complications or twists that alter your path and create new opportunities for milestones. But remember it’s not necessary to fill the quest progress track before you [[Fullfill Your Vow]]. Use the Reach a Milestone move as a pacing mechanism to move things toward an exciting conclusion with a good chance of success, but don’t fight the story when it feels inevitable. Let the chips fall where they may.


> [!quote]- Narrative example
> You need to properly arm the farmers to fight the marauding raiders, so you reach out to a black market connection and call in a favor. Once the weapons are secured, you Reach a Milestone.
