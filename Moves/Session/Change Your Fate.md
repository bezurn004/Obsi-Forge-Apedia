>[!abstract]  Context and Preparation
>**When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the game for your comfort or enjoyment**, pause and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.
>
>- Reframe: This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
>- Refocus: This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
>- Replace: This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
>- Redirect: Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
>- Reshape: The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.

## Full Description
When something occurs in your game that you do not want to happen, or want to adjust, make this move. It doesn’t matter why or in what situation a player may want to change their fate—this move can be triggered at any time a player needs it. 

When this move is triggered, the fact that the content needs to be changed is not up for argument or negotiation, but how that content is changed should be discussed as a group. The player who called for the move takes the lead in that discussion. 

Multiple options can be used at a time to make change or minimize the content as much as is needed. The changes you make can include elements of the fiction as well as mechanical outcomes. If this move is triggered because of flagged content, consider whether you need to Take a Break before or after this move is resolved.

> [!quote]- Narrative example
> You come across a wrecked spacecraft and attempt to Resupply. You roll a miss, and when you Pay the Price you discover the hold is full of aggressive, spider-like creatures. You realize that spiders are flagged content, and choose to replace that element by envisioning a toxic mold spread among the cargo containers.
