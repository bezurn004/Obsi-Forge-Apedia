# Moves [[_INDEX|Index]]
In Starforged players make Moves for their characters to interact with the narrative enabling action rolls to determine the mechanical and narrative outcomes.  [[_Assets Index|Assets]] also reference moves through abilities that provide narrative prompts that provide benefits to the move action rolls.

Don’t read this section completely. Instead, if you have a question about a specific move, activity, or best-practice, go to that section. Also remember that the moves are available as printable handouts in the Starforged Playkit. Refer to those handouts during your session, and come back to this chapter if you need guidance or want more detail.

## Three Pillars of Play
Through moves, legacy rewards, and narrative prompts, Starforged emphasizes three primary undertakings: Quests, Bonds, and Legacies.

The [[_Quest Moves|Quest Moves]], [[_Connection Moves|Connection Moves]], and [[_Exploration Moves|Exploration Moves]] directly support these gameplay pillars. They are the foundation of your Starforged adventures. Other moves help resolve the moment-to-moment perils and opportunities you encounter through these activities. 

If your story ever feels aimless, without any direction for your character, look to these three pillars. Take a quest. Build a relationship. Go explore. In fact, you’ll often do all three at once as your quest-bound adventures include interactions with key characters and expeditions into the hidden depths of the galaxy. 

Depending on the nature of your character and the assets you bring to bear, you may emphasize one pillar over the others—but none should be ignored. They are your touchstones for compelling, emotional, and surprising stories.
