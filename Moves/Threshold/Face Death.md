## Full Description
Make this move when prompted by another move such as [[Endure Harm]] or [[Withstand Damage]], or when you face a physical trauma so dire that death (or a strong chance of death) is the most likely and dramatic outcome. 

If the current situation means certain death for your character, make this move as an automatic miss. You are dead. If there is a chance to return from the brink, you should instead make an action roll. 

On a strong hit, you are alive. Consider what happens next. How did you survive? Do you return to consciousness minutes, hours, or even days later? Or was this the briefest glimpse of an averted fate? 

On a weak hit, make a choice: Is this a final, heroic sacrifice, or are you driven to accept a quest at the boundary of life and death? If you take the quest, envision how the nature of the vow is revealed through a personal epiphany or strange visitation. Then, Swear an Iron Vow and mark the doomed impact (page 52). This impact can only be cleared if you successfully Fulfill Your Vow on the quest. 

On a miss, you are dead. This is the end of your character’s story, but not their legacy. You can [[Continue a Legacy]] to learn the mark they made upon the Forge and their influence on your new character.

> [!quote]- Narrative example
> You take a hit in a gunfight, fail to Endure Harm with your health at 0, and trigger the Face Death move. You envision slumping behind cover, one hand clutching your injury. Your heartbeat fades. Blackness fills your vision. You make the roll. A strong hit! A moment later, adrenaline surges and you are gasping for breath…
