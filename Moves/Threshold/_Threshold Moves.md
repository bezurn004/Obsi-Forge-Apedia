Despite your best efforts to overcome the perils of the Forge, calamitous events may bring you to the precipice of life and death, redemption and desolation, perseverance and destruction. 

In these moments you face your greatest tests. What will become of you when all seems lost? Will you see your character undone, or find yourself on a path of renewed purpose? Make these threshold moves to find out.

These moves are (hopefully) rarely made. They are an opportunity to upend your character’s adventures, reinforce the perils of the Forge, and deepen your story. When you make a threshold move, give it a focus. Make it dramatic and personal.
