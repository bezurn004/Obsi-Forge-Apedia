## Full Description
Make this move when prompted by another move such as [[Endure Harm]]. You are at the breaking point for your character. Do you push on in spite of all you have experienced, all you have done, or do you surrender to hopelessness or darkness? Roll to find out. 

On a strong hit, you come to your senses or find renewed hope. 

On a weak hit, you must make a choice. Will you make a final, heroic stand before leaving your life as Ironsworn behind? Or will you find meaning in a soul-bound quest? If you take the quest, envision a prophetic and fearful dream or vision. Then, Swear an Iron Vow and mark the tormented impact (page 52). This impact can only be cleared if you successfully Fulfill Your Vow to see the dreaded future undone. 

On a miss, you are broken. Your time as Ironsworn is done. If this is the end of your character’s story, you can [[Continue a Legacy]] to carry on with a new character in the same setting.

> [!quote]- Narrative example
> You are on an expedition deep in the bowels of a precursor vault. When you Undertake an Expedition and roll a miss, you envision yourself lost in the vast labyrinthine passages. You hear the whirring and humming of ancient mechanical guardians closing in around you. It is too much to bear. You Endure Stress, reduce your spirit to 0, roll a miss, and trigger the Face Desolation move. The next roll will decide your fate…
