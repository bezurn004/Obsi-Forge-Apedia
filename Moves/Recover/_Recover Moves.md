Life as an Ironsworn is not easy or comfortable. When your resources are strained, your health and spirit ebbing, your equipment and vehicles in disrepair, you’ll need to find relief from the perils of the Forge and the burdens of your sworn oaths. 

Make these recover moves when you attempt to rest, recover, or refit.

These moves are primarily focused on bolstering your character’s condition meters (page 47), including health, spirit, supply, and vehicle integrity. But the [Heal](z_Obsi-Forge-Apedia/Moves/Recover/Heal.md) move is also broadly useful for giving medical aid to allies and other characters, and the [Repair](z_Obsi-Forge-Apedia/Moves/Recover/Repair.md) move can be used for any machine or device.
