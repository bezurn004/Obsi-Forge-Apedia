# [[_Moves Index|Moves]] Summary: Connection
==Connections== are NPCs (non-player characters) who represent a deep, vital, or interesting relationship in your story. They are your tethers to the people and places of the Forge. 

Make these ==connection moves== when you introduce connections and as you build influence or understanding with them.

>**[[MV_Make a Connection|Make a Connection]]**
>When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion)…

>**[[MV_Develop a Relationship|Develop a Relationship]]**
>When you reinforce your relationship with a connection…

>**[[MV_Test Your Relationship|Test Your Relationship]]**
>When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance…

>**[[MV_Forge a Bond|Forge a Bond]]**
>When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve…

Connections are not your ==allies== (protagonists portrayed by other players), nor are they ==companions== (robots, creatures, or people who accompany you on your adventures, represented by companion assets). Instead, connections are characters who are independent of you, but whose lives occasionally intersect with your own. You begin your campaign with one [[CSG_Create Local Connection|established connection]]. Others are developed through the course of your adventures. Some examples of connections include: 
* A faction representative who tasks you with missions 
* A ship mechanic at a remote facility you rely on for crucial repairs 
* A fence who helps you unload or acquire goods of dubious origin 
* An old friend who provides advice or comfort 

Connections provide story hooks for quests and support you within the scope of their role. They usually represent positive relationships, but not always; a connection might instead be a rival or someone who wields power over you. 

> [!tip] Group Play
> If you are playing with allies, a connection can be shared, in which case you track progress on that connection together. Over time, you’ll likely have a mix of shared and individual connections representing the diverse nature of your group
