## Full Description
Make this move when prompted by another move due to a negative outcome, or when the current situation naturally leads to a cost through your choices or actions. 

First, choose an option as described in the move. You may decide the outcome yourself, [[Ask the Oracle]] for insight, or roll on the included table. Whatever choice you make, always follow the fiction. If an appropriate and dramatic outcome springs to mind, go with it.

### Resolving the Cost
Once you’ve identified the basics of the negative outcome, envision it in more detail. What happens? How does it change the current situation and your approach going forward? Focusing on the fiction as you Pay the Price will lead to deeper, more dramatic stories. 

In fact, Pay the Price can often impact the narrative without an immediate mechanical cost. An initial failure may lead to a complication or force a reactive move. A failure on a subsequent move can then introduce a mechanical penalty. In this way, failures build on each other, and the situation gets riskier and more intense. 

Similarly, narrative costs that reveal major complications and dramatic surprises don’t need mechanical reinforcement. The twists and turns of your story are often enough of a price to pay. 

That said, mechanical costs help spotlight the taxing perils of the Forge, give focus to your character’s status and readiness, and serve as a price to pay when you don’t want to introduce snowballing narrative complications. If there is a mechanical cost, consider its impact. 
- If you suffer a delay or momentary setback, [[Lose Momentum]]. 
- If you face a physical hardship or injury, [[Endure Harm]]. 
- If you are disheartened or frightened, [[Endure Stress]]
- If you deplete supplies or lose preparedness, [[Sacrifice Resources]]
- If your vehicle takes a hit, [[Withstand Damage]]
- If an ally or companion is put in harm’s way, apply the cost to them. 

The narrative and mechanical costs you endure—and the focus you give to them—should fit the circumstances and the move you are making. Scoring a miss as you Battle implies a more dramatic cost than if you fail to Clash within a more detailed fight scene. For dramatic moments and decisive moves, up the stakes. 

### What's Next
Once you Pay the Price and resolve the immediate cost, envision what happens next and how you react. You are not in control. The situation is more complex and dangerous. You may need to respond with another move to restore your advantage and avoid further cost.

> [!quote]- Narrative example
> You suffer a cost during an interstellar journey, and roll on the Pay the Price table to learn that “you face a tough choice.” You envision a fierce energy storm blocking your path. You could go through it, and risk damage to your ship, or go around and delay your arrival at the next waypoint by several hours. You choose the safer course, and Lose Momentum.
