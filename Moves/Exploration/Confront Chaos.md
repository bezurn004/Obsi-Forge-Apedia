## Full Description
You may make this move only after you [[Explore a Waypoint]] and roll a **Miss with a Match**. You have stumbled across a dire discovery or inadvertently unleashed something horrific, the nature of which may have campaign shaking ramifications. 

Choose a number of aspects (one, two, or three), and pick or roll that number of times on the table. Then, envision how this threat manifests. The good news? Even chaos offers knowledge; you and your allies may mark one tick on your discoveries legacy track for each aspect you encounter.
