# [[_Moves Index|Moves]]: Undertake an Expedition
### Categories: [[_Exploration Moves|Exploration Moves]]
>[!abstract]  Context and Preparation
>This is the foundational move for a trailblazing expedition. Make this move when you initially set off on a journey or delve into the unknown, whether you are in your STARSHIP, controlling a support vehicle, or traveling on foot. Then, each time you attempt to accrue progress, make the move again to resolve that segment of the expedition. 
>
>To Begin an Expedition
>- Give it a name. 
>- Set the challenge using the standard ranks: troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic.
>Choose a rank appropriate to the fictional circumstances - the distance or scope, region, environment, threats, and your readiness. You should also consider the expedition’s importance in your story. 
>- Low ranked Expedtions
>	- If you want to move quicker to your destination.
> - High ranked Expeditions  
> 	- Represent an important aspect of your story
> 	- You want to create space for encounters, events, and side quests
>
>When you Finish an Expedition, you gain legacy rewards by marking progress on your discoveries legacy track per the rank of the expedition.

> [!error] Improper Usage
> * If you are instead making a journey through perilous known territory, such as following a mapped route or returning along an established path, make the [[Set a Course]] move to see how you fare with a single roll. 
> * If an expedition is mundane, a relatively short distance through safe territory, don’t make a move at all. Just envision the trip and jump to what happens when you arrive.
> * If you and your allies aren’t an active participant in the planning or execution of the expedition, for example, you are passengers on a spacecraft operated by an NPC, you won’t Undertake an Expedition. The journey will be resolved in the fiction. You can Ask the Oracle to determine what happens en route or when you arrive.

> [!tip]- Allies and Expeditions
>  If you are on an expedition with allies, you share a progress track and one of you makes the Undertake an Expedition roll for each segment. The responsibility for leading the expedition can switch from segment to segment as you like. An ally can assist by making the Aid Your Ally move. Perhaps they scout ahead on a planetside journey, or calibrate the eidolon drive on an interstellar voyage. 
>  
>  Opportunities for downtime during the expedition might also allow you or your allies to pursue unrelated objectives, projects, and scenes. Everyone should offer occasional narrative color for what they do and see on the expedition, even if they are not making moves.

>[!warning] Action Roll
>For each segment of the expedition, envision your approach before rolling. The Undertake an Expedition move offers three options. Choose one. 
>* Move at speed: Roll +edge 
>* Keep under the radar: Roll +shadow 
>* Stay vigilant: Roll +wits 
>
> Your stat choice should be driven by the situation, your surroundings, your character’s abilities and methods, and the nature of your vehicle or gear. It’s fine to frame your approach to best fit a favored stat, but circumstances may force you to rely on a less optimal method. 

> [!challenge-strong] On strong hit
> Mark progress per the rank of the expedition.
> > [!quote] Narrative Prompt
> > You reach a waypoint. Envision the location.

> [!challenge-weak] On a weak hit
>  As above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.
> 1. Suffer costs en route: Make a [Suffer Move](_Suffer Moves) (-2), or two [Suffer Move](_Suffer Moves) (-1).
> 2. Face a peril at the waypoint: 
>
> > [!quote] Narrative Prompt
> > Envision what you was lost, or the nature of the  encounter.  Resolve this before moving on.

> [!challenge-miss] On a miss
> Do not mark progress, and [[Pay the Price]]
> 
> > [!quote] Narrative Prompt
> >  You are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to confront an immediate hardship or threat. Resolve this before moving on. 

>[!quote]- Narrative Example
>Guiding your STARSHIP on an interstellar expedition, you find yourself in a vast nebula wracked by energy storms. Your ship is equipped with an ENGINE UPGRADE and rigged for speed, but the nebula forces caution. You Undertake an Expedition and roll +wits as you navigate carefully through the chaotic storms.

## Reaching a Waypoint
Each segment of the expedition is marked by a waypoint. The locations, features, or encounters at a waypoint will create context for your exploration and the result of your moves. 

Envision the details of a waypoint using the established nature of the expedition, the environment, and the outcome of the move. Or Ask the Oracle for inspiration. In Chapter 5, you’ll find procedures for generating locations for spaceborne expeditions (page 301), planets (page 307), derelicts (page 350), and precursor vaults (page 362). 

For long-range spaceborne expeditions, your STARSHIP cruises the interstellar drifts, and each segment of the journey ends at a waypoint called an anchorage. Additionally, navigating complex areas of space such as asteroid fields or energy-wracked nebulas can provide waypoints in your expedition. See page 68 for details on interstellar travel and exploration in the Forge. 

Depending on the pace of your story and your current situation, you may choose to focus on a waypoint. An extraordinary location or discovery might offer an opportunity to Explore a Waypoint. Or you can play out a scene not involving moves as you interact with your allies or the world. Mix it up. Some segments of travel will pass as a brief montage. Others are chances to zoom in, enriching your story and your setting. The moves will help prompt and guide your focus, but, like the director of a movie, you and your fellow players also have control. When it matters, when it’s interesting or dramatic, zoom in. Use those moments to reveal interesting details, introduce complications, or deepen your characters.

>[!tip] Tips for Guides
>If you are playing as the guide, you can Ask the Oracle to reveal the features of a waypoint or simply envision and describe the surroundings. You can also give narrative control to your players, encouraging them to make oracle rolls and interpret the results.

## Resolving the Outcome 
On a strong hit, mark progress per the rank of the expedition as you reach the waypoint. For example, on a dangerous journey, mark two progress (filling two boxes on your progress track). 

On a weak hit, you mark progress but must also suffer a cost. You’ll choose between two options: 
* Suffer costs en route: Endure the wear and tear of the arduous journey with one suffer move at a serious cost (-2) or two suffer moves at a minor cost (-1). As appropriate to the situation, these suffer moves can apply to any combination of yourself, a vehicle, an ally, or a companion. This is the option to take if you want to quickly envision a cost and move on. 
* Face a peril at the waypoint: Introduce a danger that poses a hazard but does not inflict an immediate cost. You’ll need to take action to overcome or outwit this danger. This is the option to choose if you want to zoom in and give the threat some focus. 

When you have accumulated enough progress and are ready to wrap up an expedition, make the Finish an Expedition move. 

When you Undertake an Expedition and score a miss, you do not mark progress and must Pay the Price. You might face an environmental hazard, an encounter with a threatening lifeform, an attack by foes, equipment failures, foreboding discoveries, or supernatural events. Decide what happens based on your current circumstances and surroundings, roll on the Pay the Price table, or Ask the Oracle for inspiration. Depending on the nature and focus of the cost, you can play out the event to see what happens, or summarize and apply consequences immediately. 

>[!quote]- Narrative Example
>You are exploring the surface of a grave world. When you Undertake an Expedition and roll a miss, you envision the onset of a sudden and violent acid rain. You are disoriented and lose the path, and do not mark progress. Plus, you must now Face Danger to find shelter before the corrosion compromises your environment suit. You imagine each drop of rain sizzling against the visor of your helmet…

## Expedition Perils
If you encounter a peril on an expedition because of a weak hit or miss, consider the nature of the danger as appropriate to the current situation. If you need inspiration, Ask the Oracle. You’ll find oracles to help inspire perils for various location types, including space (page 304), planets (page 320), derelicts (page 352–359), and precursor vaults (pages 366–369). Abstract oracles such as Action and Theme (pages 296–297) can also spark ideas for a perilous situation.

You might also encounter a peril, regardless of the outcome of the move, if you Ask the Oracle to reveal the details of a waypoint. The Forge, after all, is full of mystery and danger. In that case, you should let the approach you used to Undertake an Expedition (your stat choice, per the options in the move) and the outcome of your roll (strong hit, weak hit, or miss) help frame the situation as you face that unexpected danger. 

For example, if you roll +shadow as you Undertake an Expedition on an interstellar journey, you are trying to keep your STARSHIP undetected by potential foes. If you arrive at a waypoint to find a horde of pirate ships, interpret what happens next with that framing in mind. 
* If you rolled a strong hit, you are in control. Your stealthy approach means the pirates don’t see you, and you are in position to observe them or sneak away without risk—no move needed. 
* If you rolled a weak hit, you’re at risk. They haven’t seen you, but you’ll likely need to make a move such as Face Danger to avoid catching their attention. 
* If you rolled a miss, the pirates are already upon you. Enter the Fray.
