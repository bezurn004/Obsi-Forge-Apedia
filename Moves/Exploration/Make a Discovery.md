## Full Description
You may make this move only when you Explore a Waypoint and roll a strong hit with a match. This represents uncovering something extraordinary, the nature of which you’ll define by choosing or rolling on the table. This is a dramatic, rare event, worthy of focus in your story. Take a moment to envision the result or talk it through with others at your table. The discovery should deepen your understanding of the setting, introduce revelations that may contradict accepted truths, or reveal a rare and valuable treasure. 

Once you’ve established the nature of the discovery and interacted with it in the fiction, you and your allies may mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.
