> The scene challenge progress track and tension clock are shared with your allies. Guided by the fiction, move the focus among the characters. Any allies involved in the scene can make the [[Face Danger]] or [[Secure an Advantage]] move. Any character can also [[Aid Your Ally]] to contribute to a move another character is about to make.

## Full Description
A scene challenge is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency. Examples of a scene challenge include disarming a timed explosive, hacking a system while evading digital countermeasures, participating in a formal debate, or competing in a hoverbike race. 

To start a scene challenge, make the Begin the Scene move. As part of this move, you’ll create a standard progress track (troublesome, dangerous, or formidable) to measure your headway towards an objective. You’ll also set a tension clock of four segments to represent the gains made by your opponents or the advancement of a looming threat or deadline.

When choosing the rank of the objective, consider the scope of the situation and your level of readiness. If unsure, make it dangerous
