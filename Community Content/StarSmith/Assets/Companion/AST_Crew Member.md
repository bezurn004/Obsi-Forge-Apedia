# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Companion Assets|Companion]]: Crew Member
What started as a loosely aligned group of iron homes wandering through the Forge grew into something much more. Mutual protection pacts led to the cooperative creation of more advanced defenses and starships to insure they would make it to a new home. Of course, this was predicated upon advances within several scientific disciplines which further entwined the alliance members through shared experiments and results. By the time the iron homes were being decommissioned, the alliance was so firmly formed that only a name was needed: CAP, the Conglomeration of Allied Planets.

The CAP command center, CAP-COM, was established on a central planet, and the Academy of Studies for CAP, or ASCAP, formed a few short years later. With general peace in the immediate regions, an armada of cutting edge starships were designed and built with a primary purpose of exploration to connect with far flung or floundering iron homes. This interstellar naval branch of CAP was dubbed the STARMADA!

The academy churned out top level engineers, scientists, medical doctors, counselors, technicians, security officers, diplomats, and commanders who all joined together, almost as a family, for 5-year missions of exploration. The crew, led by a competent core of officers, learned to work as one and to boldly go through the Forge seeking out new worlds and offering assistance to those in need.

While the primary mission is exploration, the Starmada is well-equipped to defend themselves when the need arises. However, diplomacy is always the first choice; violence the last

## Commentary
The first ability is a copy of the original Sidekick asset’s first ability except that it is narrowed to use within their role on the ship. However, you don’t necessarily have to be aboard the command vehicle to use this ability. For example, a security chief might escort you planetside on a diplomatic mission that turns hostile. If you were to Face Danger by having them race you to a defensible area, you could use this ability.

The second ability is the classic Star Trek: Next Gen round table discussion led by the wise Captain Picard. You may want to use the implicit condition here that you would need to have time enough to conference in order for this ability to be triggered. For example, if you are in the middle of a starship battle, you likely wouldn’t take time out to conference like this, but if you were stranded in an acidic nebula that was slowly eating your ship’s hull, that would be an excellent time to conference.

The third ability I affectionately refer to as the Red Shirt ability. The scene went out of control quickly, and the poor crew member who only had one line of dialogue just got vaporized. However, that gives the captain enough time to make a dramatic escape or even turn the tide back to the side of the good guys.

> A faction of rogue AI are on a mission to bring peace to the galaxy by assimilating all life into a single unified hivemind. To fuel their nano-tech and horrific starships, they gather resources by using powerful tractor beams to rip the water and outer crust from a planet which is then sorted into constituent elements. Their fleet was last spotted headed to a sector you are familiar with where the people have decided to fight. Who lives in that sector that once saved your life so that you now feel compelled to help save theirs? ^QuestStarter
