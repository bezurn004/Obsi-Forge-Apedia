# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Companion Assets|Companion]]: Furball
The species colloquially known as furballs are tiny animal like a cross between a cat and a monkey who spend most of their time slouched in a spherical shape. When they finally decide to move around, it is at the speed of a sloth.

Despite their ability to proliferate swiftly and in large numbers, furballs were near extinction on their native world due to environmental stress stunting their reproductive cycle. After careful study and deliberation, a group of scientists stepped in to domesticate them finding that to be the best option for their future survival. While many animal rights groups protested this action, extensive research has been done on the creatures which showed that living with a human as a pet has many benefits for the furball as well as the human. It is a great success story of saving a whole species.

Since the publication of this research, furballs have been widely adopted not only as household pets but as service animals in the field of mental health. The cooing noises these creatures make resonate at a frequency that produces endorphins and feelings of tranquility in most organic forms of life. They are beloved by all and held up as an icon of peace across the Forge.

The only problem they have ever presented in society is their occasional over population. When background cosmic harmonics coincide with times of particular peace and contentment, furballs asexually reproduce at an exponential rate. While this is normally seen as a blessing, it has led to damage on starships where the physical spaces become crowded with a full huddle of these adorable creatures. That happenstance is known as the foible with furballs.

## Commentary
The first ability represents your character gaining comfort from their relationship with their furball. These cuddly little guys can melt even a heart of stone. Most of the time they just sit there like a ball of fur, but every once in a while when you stop petting, they sit up on their hind legs and look at you with those eyes begging for more cuddle time. (Just got a dog who is basically this!) However, that nearly full-time bonus comes with a cost if you bring your furball into dangerous situations.

The second ability is about using your furball as a diplomatic animal companion. They can help calm nerves and establish trust where it otherwise might not be possible. You might Secure an Advantage by getting someone to vouch for you or Face Danger by trying to talk down an angry faction leader. I guess this is emotional manipulation, but it comes in a tiny package of cuteness.

The furballs are basically born to love and be loved, so when you make a move in the same vein as per the third ability, you get a boost. That means your relationships flow more smoothly when everyone is chill with the furball love vibes.

## Quest Starter
> One faction leader wants to make amends with a rival faction leader, and a gift of a furball is widely viewed as the most sincere gift possible since they can detect the stress of a situation. However, while the gift is meant to genuinely start a new chapter in the relationship between the two factions, tensions are still high. Why do you need these two factions to cooperate? What is at stake if they donâ€™t? ^QuestStarter
