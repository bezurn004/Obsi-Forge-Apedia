# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Companion Assets|Companion]]: Waterwyrm
Waterwyrms are great dragon-like sea serpents from the planet Lerih that can grow up to the thickness of the largest species of tree and the length of several space shuttles. They are the undisputed top of the food chain on their home planet and hunt with speed, cunning, and ferocity. What we did not expect was the empathic connection they can make with a human.

Bonding with a waterwyrm takes time, skill, an open heart, and a lot of luck. While we don’t know the scientific nature of how a lasting bond works, we do know that those with intentions of oceanic exploration and mastery are more likely to be accepted by a waterwyrm than eaten by it. Once a ritualistic bond has been forged, a shell is collected from the sea floor den where the waterwyrm made its home. This shell is fashioned into a necklace and worn much like a charm and helps to focus and channel the empathic connection and communication between human and beast. These shells are often handed down through three or four generations as a waterwyrm’s lifespan is far longer than our own.

Seeing not only their usefulness in exploring newly discovered water worlds but also their joy at doing so, vast saltwater tanks were developed to allow waterwyrms to accompany their bondmate on interstellar missions to new planets. With enough patience and practice, the human bondmate can harness and ride the waterwyrm through the seas of these strange new worlds.

## Commentary
The first ability is a carbon-copy of the Rockhorn asset’s first ability. It is just framed a little differently in the narrative.

The second ability makes use of the waterwyrm’s long serpentine body. Depending on how big you would like to make your waterwyrm, they could entangle anything from a shark to a whale to a fishing boat to a huge cruise ship. Remember that whatever size you make your waterwyrm, you’ll need a command vehicle with enough space to fit their saltwater tank if you want to take them with you on your travels through the stars.

The third ability is purely for exploration of an underwater region. I imagined that characters would have a diving suit of some kind so that you can sustain this exploration over the long haul, but you can flavor it as them swimming with their head out of the water as you ride along if that suits you better.

Notice that on most of these moves you only get narrative framing and rolling +its health. I didn’t put any adds on the abilities because the waterwyrm has a high health that you can utilize making it almost like an add already.

> An underwater city on the planet Waĳi had a catastrophic failure of its protective dome. Because the surface of the planet is toxic to humans, the survivors are in small lifepods spread out on the ocean floor by strong currents. Who do you know on Waĳi that is among the missing? What do they still owe you that you are willing to mount a rescue mission? ^QuestStarter
