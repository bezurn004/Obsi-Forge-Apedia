# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Companion Assets|Companion]]: Nano-swarm
At the advent of nanites, they were banned from being able to selfreplicate. It was thought that a swarm of nanites might consume all matter in the universe turning it into a giant glob of gray goo. While that hasn’t happened yet, there was no way to enforce the ban and self-replication became the norm for these tiny bots.

The field of medical sciences was one of the first to adopt the use of nanites to deliver medication to or operate on specific cells, but their uses soon became more universal. At this point, many high grade tool kits are not actually tools but a group of nanites that can change their shape into whatever tool is needed at the time. They can also increase or decrease their density, heat-resistance, or any number of other characteristics given enough time and programming.

Surveillance was the next logical jump for these creations. They could spread out across an environment so thin as to be nearly undetectable while logging precision data on all aspects of the area and those in it. As is always the case, this led to an arms race where nanite defensive experts worked tirelessly to protect people from the ever-evolving abilities of a swarm.

The first military to adapt the use of nanite swarms in combat was ostensibly trying to limit the amount of human casualties. The bots were programmed to simply overwhelm and incapacitate enemies thereby winning the day without the loss of life. Unfortunately, there are those bad actors who took nano-swarms to the next level of violence by having them literally consume their enemies to fuel their regenerative powers.

## Commentary
This asset is like a combination of the original Sprite, Utility Bot, and Combat Bot assets. However, it does take you time to reprogram the swarm to suit your needs, and they lose power with each use. I imagine a tiny touch pad and holding compartment worn like a watch on your wrist that is used to deploy and program the swarm.

The first ability is a boost to engineering or techie type characters. Don’t have a self-sealing stembolt handy? Have your swarm become one that keeps the equipment running long enough to get true repairs. This is like the Utility Bot.

The second ability helps you to spy on others and is very similar the Sprite asset. Again, I imagine you’re looking at the view screen on your watch control pad and have a wireless earbud to hear what’s going on. I’m sure this could be set to record so that you could use it to Secure an Advantage through blackmail if that’s the type of character you enjoy playing.

The third ability is its attack mode which means you can get one add +2 and then one add +1 before they need time to recharge and self-replicate again.

## Quest Starter
> A nano-swarm’s programming was distorted in a surge of unusual energy. The original purpose of the swarm was surveillance, but it is now consuming and destroying the building that it was sent to spy on. No organization has come forward to take responsibility, and the city at large is becoming increasingly at risk. Without the original programmer’s codes, the swarm cannot be remotely deactivated. Who do you think is responsible, and what telltale sign did you notice about the swarm that hints at the owner? What makes you think that you can stop this spreading swarm? ^QuestStarter
