# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Module Assets|Modules]]: AssetName
Land, air, and space are not the only mediums worthy of exploration. Oceans, whether of water or other liquids, often must be traversed to find the precious resources necessary for survival in the vastness of the Forge. Moreover, some ocean worlds are only viable for habitation in underwater cities because the surface waters are so stormy. This, in turn, necessitates travel from water to space without the benefit of a land launch. Cue the aquatic HOV.

Aquatic HOVs (human occupied vehicles) that are prepped for use with a command-level starship are capable of being launched from orbit directly into the deep waters of an ocean. This is admittedly a little bit of a rough ride on the occupants, but injury occurrences are well within the acceptable norms. This arrangement allows a starship to be dispatched to a water world and then to directly assess the quality of the ocean immediately. No need to wait for a temporary base to be built on the surface or underwater.

Once the exploration is complete, the aquatic HOV fires its pre-primed rocket booster to blast itself back into orbit where it can be pulled into the command vehicle support bay and prepped for the next survey mission. Recharging the rockets, cleaning of the water-oxygen electrolysis system, and other maintenance can all be done in a drydock-type environment inside the support bay. The handy vehicles have room for several people, various scientific equipment, and supplies enough to last for days depending on the needs of the mission. The upgraded versions also include enhanced scanners and robotic arms.

## Commentary
The first ability skips over the launch phase and getting into the water. I just assume that if you take this asset, you want to explore underwater, so you just make it there automatically. If you would like to make a roll to see how successful you are getting into the water intact, you’re welcome to roll a Face Danger move +the aquatic HOVs integrity. Otherwise, the first ability has you making moves underwater.

The second ability gives you the upgraded sensors, and the third gives you the manipulator arms so that you can grab underwater goodies.

Note that what you don’t have are weapons. If you really want a weapon system on your sub, you can of course have it. It’s your game, after all! If that’s the case, I would suggest removing the sensors and replace it with a weapons system. You might consider granting a +1 to momentum on a strong with a weapons system or something a little smaller in mechanical benefit as you would be gaining a lot of narrative benefit already just by having weapons.

> The notorious pirate vessel known as the Orion Hunter supposedly crashed on the planet Balylu, a water world with exceptionally high gravity. The oceans of the world are so deep and water so compressed by the gravity that orbital scans cannot get a read on the derelict vessel’s location. What precious cargo was the Orion Hunter rumored to be carrying when it went down, and why would it be dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands? ^QuestStarter
