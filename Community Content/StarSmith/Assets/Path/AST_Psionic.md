# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Psionic
Psionics are those who have the power to influence another person’s mind, will and perception. As you can imagine, this is another ability that is generally outlawed as overriding a person’s free will is considered the gravest violation. Those who are discovered to have psionic abilities are known to disappear in the middle of the night as either a casualty in the ongoing purge to root out psionics or as an involuntary recruitment to a shadowy organization.

At one point in recent history, there was a movement to have psionics register their abilities through the government and only be able to use those abilities under controlled circumstances when all parties agreed to it such as trade agreements. In fact, these espers (as psionics were called at the time) became a standard part of any treaty signing, business deal, or political interaction. However, when it was discovered that a powerful esper had been influencing political parties rather than negotiating in good faith, the psionic community quickly lost the good will they had built and became hunted again.

Despite their pariah status, the psionic community has continued to thrive in the shadows. With their ability to subtly influence those around them, they are rarely discovered as long as they are careful. It is only the high profile cases that continue to cause problems for the community as a whole.

Some psionics make good money as a type of mental drug dealer. For the right price, they can project life-like illusions into the mind of person. For a willing participant, these illusions can be powerful and feel like reality allowing someone to connect with a lost loved one or interact with the lover of their dreams.

## Commentary
The first ability is your basic charm spell from fantasy lore allowing you to influence the behavior of another person. However, there are restrictions so that you can’t suggest someone jump off a cliff. Note that if a person wants to do the action anyway, the add +1 stacks with rolling with advantage. Also note that the outcome of this Compel roll would be the normal outcome of the Compel move. If you’d like to put some more restraints on this ability, I would suggest that on a weak hit, the target is aware of the psionic compulsion.

The second ability is a lie detector / truth serum. I debated on making the Compel people to speak truthfully be instead a Gather Information move, but ultimately I went back to Compel because it really is about convincing people to speak truthfully only. The Gather Information would come after the Compel because they could choose to simply be silent rather than speak the truth.

The third ability lets you roll with advantage when leveraging your illusion projecting power against a single target, but this doesn’t stop you from trying to project an illusion against multiple targets since having psionics in general gives you the narrative framing to do so. You just wouldn’t get the benefit of rolling with advantage.

## Quest Starter
> The mastermind behind a particularly powerful crime syndicate wields truly awesome psionic powers. Nobody with ill intent can get close to this overlord without turning away at a suggestion, and anyone who meets this person comes back with a different picture in their mind of who this person is. One faction is desperately seeking the identity of this criminal mastermind. How have you crossed paths with this psionic in the past? What makes you willing to undertake this mission? ^QuestStarter
