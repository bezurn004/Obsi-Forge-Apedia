# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Logistician
Many are the adherents to religion and spirituality, but few are those who actually apply those tenets. Even fewer are those dedicated followers of only logic and reason. Emotions constantly bubble to the surface, and humans are notoriously bad at ignoring them when a logical and reasoned response is necessary.

The logisticians are an order of people who are better than most at suppressing emotions in favor of logic. They have strict training monasteries where they devote themselves to the art and aesthetic of pure reason. Adherents will often stay cloistered for decades before venturing back into the world as a changed person.

It is said that a person who completes this taxing training gains such a mastery over their own mind that no problem is unsolvable for them. They have an intuition that allows them to gain insights simply by silently meditating. When they read a text, they can read between the lines with such accuracy that it seems magical in nature. If a logistician speaks, you would do well to listen.

However, this level of strict training has its dark side as well. Suppressing emotions takes its toll on both the body and spirit which can lead to explosive outbursts of rage or worse. Many logisticians try to keep this in check through Freudian releases of pent-up emotions in more controlled environments. Some logisticians will attempt to release their energy on hunting trips, taking up more expressive art projects, or even by demolishing whole buildings

## Commentary
The first ability is essentially the second ability from the original Seer asset but through the narrative lens of pure logic rather than a prophetic vision. Think of it as Spock or Sherlock Holmes thinking ahead through all the possibilities and teasing out the most likely one. You can mentally play out scenarios to see how they came about or notice something that other people missed. It’s the embodiment of the quote, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” - Arthur Conan Doyle.

The second ability is an extension of the first except for when research can give you the upper hand in a situation.

The third ability gives a new stat to Compel with. Normally, if you were reasoning with someone, it would likely be a roll +heart because the +shadow and +iron options don’t really fit a calm, reasoned argument. However, I don’t think +heart really fits that either. I think the +wits roll represents someone speaking super over the top intellectually about a topic or situation so much so that you just have to believe them. Think of it as big brain charm.

## Quest Starter
> The Order of the Mobius Mind was considered one of the premier schools of logic before it was utterly destroyed by an unprovoked attack led by a powerful faction. Which faction is responsible for this attack, and what were they hoping to achieve with this attack? What makes you think that someone from the Mobius Mind is still out there, and why would you risk the faction’s wrath to find this person? ^QuestStarter
