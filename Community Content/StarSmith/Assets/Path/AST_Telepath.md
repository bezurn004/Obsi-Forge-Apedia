# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Telepath
Telepathic abilities allow a proficient user to connect to the mind of another person, usually these connections are benign in nature and used mainly for communication purposes. If possible, military groups like to have squadron leaders with telepathy so they can transmit orders without fear of being intercepted by the enemy. The more powerful the telepathic abilities, the more people the telepath can link to.

Those who are joined together in a telepathic link are known as a myalo, and being a member of such a group takes practice, patience, and forgiveness as sometimes thoughts are shared too readily. With time, myalin (members of a myalo) can filter the thoughts that they send across the telepathic link. Strong emotions make it more difficult to suppress the sending of some thoughts, but most learn well enough to make the connection more useful than a detriment. Because of the openness of the minds within a myalo, myalin typically form close bonds with one another in a familial way.

Like all tools, the way telepathy is used makes a difference. General communication is not frowned upon, but more invasive means of telepathy are the well-known darker side of these abilities. A powerful enough telepath can see through the eyes of a nearby person or creature with or without their consent.

Even more powerful telepaths are able to alter the memories of a person or creature, again with or without their consent. Sometimes this ability is put to use to help someone who is grief-stricken to forget about the loss of a loved one, but more likely than not, these alterations are more nefarious in purpose. Usually, these alterations are not permanent and need regular maintenance to stay altered.

## Commentary
The first ability is a basic mind link, but you have to be in physical contact with the person to establish the link. While I didn’t put that it needed to be a willing participant, I think that is the proper implication. If you try to establish a link with an unwilling participant, you might consider rolling with disadvantage instead of getting the boost. I didn’t put how long it takes for the link to fade on a weak hit so you can use that as a miss consequence on other moves if necessary. Also, feel free to remove or alter the limitation on how many links can be active. I just used a number that made sense to me.

For the second ability, it should also be understood that you are in physical contact with the person. It’s not easy to alter someone’s memories, so it requires time and proximity. The memory changes are never permanent, so they could come back to haunt you at the worst time (like when you roll a miss with a match).

The third ability was originally the old locate object spell just hĳacking someone’s senses to do so, and then I realized that if you’re hĳacking senses to locate an object, you can hĳack senses period.

## Quest Starter
> The leader of a faction suffered an attack by a telepath who completely erased some memories. To make matters worse, the memories are not returning even after a fortnight of waiting. Talking through multiple issues with the leader’s staff and trusted confidants has not revealed any gaps in memory to clue them in on the subject of the missing memories. What clue do you have as to the topic of the missing memories? Why are you willing to track down this telepath in the hopes of learning about these memories before the leader gets them back? ^QuestStarter
