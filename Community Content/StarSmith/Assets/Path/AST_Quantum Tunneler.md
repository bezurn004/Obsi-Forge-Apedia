# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Quantum Tunneler
String theory long posited that each universe within the multiverse had its own distinct vibrational frequency. Quantum tunneling is the act of being so in tune with those vibrations as to ride them to their next peak or trough. At least that’s the way the scientists explain it to the lay folk. In reality, we believe that practitioners of quantum tunneling are actually quantum entangling themselves to a specific location that they can “feel” through the vibrational frequencies of the universe. Of course, this is all speculation as the ability is more an art and intuitive process than a scientific one.

As you can imagine, short range teleportation does lend itself to a life of crime, and as such, a booming business sector has grown around development of teleportation blockers. Unfortunately for most, fortunately for a few, many of these blockers have ended up no better than the snake oil of old. The theory of how quantum tunneling works is advanced enough that defense mechanisms make sense on paper but not advanced enough to actually make a working product.

The best defensive products have been architectural in nature such as the puzzler room that is a multi-layered cube with constantly sliding parts and sections. An object or treasure that you want to protect can be placed in a puzzler room which moves so often and so quickly that when a quantum tunneler tries to infiltrate, they end up with half their body in one section of the room and the other half in another section. As the sections move, you can imagine what happens to the tunneler.

> [!note] Ability 1
> - [x] When you [[MV_Face Danger|Face Danger]] or [[MV_Secure an Advantage|Secure an Advantage]] by quantum tunneling to a position nearby and within sight, add +2 but treat a weak hit as a miss.
> If through an obstacle to a nearby but unseen location, treat a weak hit as a miss but take +2 momentum on a strong hit. ^Ability1
___
> [!info] Ability 2
> - [ ] When you [[MV_Clash|Clash]] and score a weak hit, you may forgo marking progress to be in control as you tunnel away.
> When you [[MV_Strike|Strike]] and score a weak hit, you may mark progress only once (instead of twice) to be in control as you tunnel to reposition. ^Ability2
___
> [!todo] Ability 3
> - [ ] When you attempt to quantum entangle yourself to a location, roll +heart or +wits. #ConvertAbilityToMove
> - On a hit, you may quantum tunnel to that location from any distance, but it is dangerous.
> - On a miss, as above but the entangling is harmful. [[MV_Endure Harm|Endure Harm]] (-2). 
> When you [[MV_Face Danger|Face Danger]] to do so, treat a weak hit as a miss. Once used, the entanglement fades. ^Ability3

## Commentary
I hate to keep making comic book references, but that’s the best way to describe these abilities since the Quantum Tunneler is Nightcrawler. You can BAMF around over short distances.

I thought about making this drain momentum to use, but ultimately decided against it because there are plenty of narrative and mechanical consequences you can apply to yourself on a failed teleport. You might end up in the exact wrong spot or stuck in a wall, or maybe you show up in the right spot but your equipment didn’t survive the teleport.

The first ability here is the basic teleportation letting you jump around. Note that jumping through an obstacle is inherently more dangerous but can really build the momentum quickly.

The second ability is the combat version where someone is attacking you and suddenly you show up behind them. It allows you to keep the better positioning by being in control with the penalty of giving up some progress that could have been marked. It makes combat a bit slower but more sure.

The third ability is modeled after the second ability on the original Looper asset but instead of anchoring yourself to a time, you’re anchoring yourself to a place. Even if that place moves, like your command vehicle, you go wherever it goes because it’s the actual atoms of that location that you are entangled with, not its galactic GPS coordinates.

## Quest Starter
> A cat burglar has plagued the local megacity and is thought to be making their getaways using quantum tunneling. What items have they been stealing that hold significance in your life? What pattern have you noticed in the thefts that the local authorities have not figured out yet? ^QuestStarter
