# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: well Connected
Humans have been social creatures since time immemorial, and life in the Forge is no different. The unfortunate truth is that it’s often more about who you know than what you know, so those who develop their social graces see exponential payoffs more quickly. While this seems manipulative and inauthentic to some, there are those few people who truly care in an authentic manner about even the smallest relationship, and it’s these elite socialites who can make the deal when it counts.

A prime example is the story of Luthia Barthelway, a humble pizza delivery girl in the megacity New Atlantis on the watery planet of Mizuvoda. There wasn’t a billionaire in the city that she hadn’t delivered pizza to, and she picked up a thing or two about each one during her deliveries. Soon, people were calling Luthia for advice on how to get just one minute with Jeve Stobs or Gill Bates, but Luthia didn’t bite. She knew better. She told them she would do what she could, but she was only a pizza girl with no real insider information.

One night, Mr. Stobs was having another late work session with his development team who was hungry and tired. The pizza hit the spot, but more importantly, Luthia struck the right chord by serving individual slices to everyone. Not out of slick self-promotion, mind you, but just because she cared. While serving the team, she heard several mentions of “Where are we going to find an expert on AI partitioning protocols this late in the project?”

Luthia hadn’t the slightest idea what AI partitioning was, but someone else she regularly delivered for was known for coding AI. “I may know someone who can help,” said Luthia. After that night, Mr. Stobs ordered pizza much more often.

## Commentary
The first ability is all about setting up a two-move combo where having an expert opinion is useful. The obvious combo is Secure an Advantage and then Gather Information, but it could equally be Secure an Advantage followed by a Face Danger where the expert can walk you through defusing a bomb or followed by Gain Ground where you capture a strategic position because you called up someone with access to the classified blueprints of a compound.

It's basically you saying, “I might know someone who can help.” Note that it really is “might.” This is not using a normal connection. It’s you making up a brand new NPC who may being willing to help you this time and become an actual connection after working with you. The second ability is about becoming a friend of a friend. It strengthens all the bonds in the relationships.

The third ability is about name-dropping, but if you miss, your name-dropped connection may be totally mad that you blatantly attempted to use their reputation for your own gain.

## Quest Starter
> Reality is breaking. A micro-tear in the space-time continuum is threatening to become a full breach within one week. The local authorities are keeping the potential breach a secret but need help gathering a team of experts to immediately address the issue before it becomes a crisis. Who do you know that has dealt with a related problem before? What makes getting them to the micro-tear a difficult and dangerous task. ^QuestStarter
