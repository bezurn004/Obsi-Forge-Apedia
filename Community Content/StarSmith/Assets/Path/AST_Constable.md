# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Constable
Law and order can be a fluid concept in the Forge. Jurisdiction claims often overlap across sectors setting up conflicts between factions and governments, and even within a single jurisdiction, the governmental seat is often far enough away that the local authority takes liberties with how they apply the law.

To help smooth this disparate situation, most governments agreed to establish the position of constable as an authorized agent of the government. Not all governments care or respect this authority, but if a person comes in with the credentials of a constable, they are at least acknowledged as authorized representatives of their respective government.

As in most positions of power, the size of the circles of influence matter. A constable from a larger faction is often given more leeway than a constable from a smaller faction unless that smaller faction wields more influence in the immediate area. It’s all a song and dance deciding which laws supersede the others.

Regardless, most constables are more sheriff than diplomat. They care more about bringing a criminal to justice than following the niceties and protocols of governmental interaction. Constables are people of action, people of purpose, and people of principles. This singularity of focus can earn them more respect than any badge they wear from their local authority.

## Commentary
The first ability may be viewed as closely related to the third, so allow me to differentiate. When you Compel, you’re usually making a command like, “Stop in the name of the law!” or “Hand over those stolen goods.” While in certain narrative circumstances you might Compel someone to tell you the truth, that action is likely better suited to a Gather Information roll than Compel. However, other than gathering intel, if you are adding the phrase, “in the name of the law” to your ask, you are likely triggering the first ability as long as the person actually knows and/or respects the particular authority you represent.

The second ability lets you more easily make connections after solving a crime. There can sometimes be a little hero worship when an authority swoops in to the rescue, and this gives you a bonus toward establishing that relationship in a more formal way.

The third ability is basically the second half of the first ability on the original Sleuth asset. In reality, this Constable asset is supposed to be a reflavored version of the investigator concept presented in the Sleuth asset.

## Quest Starter
> The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. The gunslinger had the accouterments of a constable from the faction known as the Dark Tower and was tight-lipped about the crimes of the man in black. However, you know something about the man in black that the constable does not. What is it, and why does it compel you to join the constable on the hunt for this mysterious criminal? ^QuestStarter
