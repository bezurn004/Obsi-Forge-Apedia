# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Enhanced
Humankind has long sought immortality through genetic therapy and enhancements. Efforts to slow the effects of aging, increase muscle mass, and supercharge neurological connections in the brain all yielded some fruit but only enough to ease the transition from life to death, not make superhumans. While those experiments were fully sanctioned and supported by governing agencies, more exotic experiments were underway in hidden facilities across the Forge.

Strange and unknown DNA samples have been part of the treasures found within precursor vaults, and for some scientists with a less than ethical bent, this was an invitation to alter, and perhaps upgrade, the human genome. Raids have been conducted to shut down illegal labs that force genetic alterations on the poor, misguided, duped and desperate.

While most people don’t survive the splicing of foreign DNA into the body, there are those few who emerge with strange abilities or augmentations. These people are known as the Enhanced.

One of the few universal laws in the Forge is that any experiment designed to created an enhanced individual is illegal. In fact, most municipalities make it a crime to be enhanced and will incarcerate enhanced individuals giving them the choice between life in prison or undergoing a dangerous DNA removal process.

Of course, these laws and procedures seem only to apply to the common folk of the Forge as many high level officials and politicians are rumored to be enhanced themselves. Those who can keep their enhancements hidden may reap great benefits in the short term, but no one can hide forever

## Commentary
This asset is mainly a reskin of the original Augmented asset but with a genetic flavor rather than cybernetic. The first ability has you define your specific enhancement and how people react to it. You might have alien DNA giving you strange and unusual powers, have eagle DNA to give you super sight, or have lizard DNA giving you the power to regenerate. While the lore on the previous page marks all enhancements as illegal around the Forge, you should feel free to flavor it in your own version of the Forge as you wish.

Also know that the change to your body doesn’t have to be immediately noticeable like a third arm. It could be a change to your eyesight or your brain that offers you new sensory details. It could be increased bone density and muscle tension allowing super jumps. It could be regenerative healing. It really is open to any interpretation you want.

The second ability gives you a second enhancement, but note that it does not stack with the first one.

The third ability is meant to drive narrative. What if your DNA held the key human immortality? What if it contains the roadmap to reviving the ancient precursor people? You can also make this ability repeatable if you want so that the third ability doesn’t become useless after finishing the quest.

## Quest Starter
> Rumors of truly alien DNA being available at a certain black market are swirling out from a distant sector. If these rumors are true, whoever holds this DNA could hold the power to craft a history that is as yet unwritten. One faction has a particularly nefarious purpose in mind. What is it, and how does it threaten something dear to you? ^QuestStarter
