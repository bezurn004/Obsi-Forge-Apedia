# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Rebel
No matter how far humans have traveled away from our original solar system, we have yet to escape our proclivity for tyranny and oppression. Thus, we continue to need those who are brave enough to stand up and fight. We need rebels.

At this point in history, factions hold more sway than governments. They dictate the rules of society to fit their own needs rather than the needs of the people. Whether their ultimate goal is fueling the insatiable hunger of capitalism or stamping out thoughts and beliefs contrary to their own, tyrannical factions have very little in the way of regulations or oversight to stand in their way. Enter the rebellion.

While no one enjoys the loss of life that comes when an interstellar war is waged, it is widely acknowledged that rebellions led by principled freedom fighters are about the only method to throw off the shackles of an oppressive faction. Laws simply don’t apply once a faction gets big enough to hold the majority of the power and resources, and the old mantra of “absolute power corrupts absolutely” still holds true.

Rebels can take on many guises from soldier to spy to infiltrator to saboteur, but all of them dependent on one crucial currency: information. Without a reliable network of intelligence gathering, no rebel can be successful. And so it is that you may get a garbled message one day from an insider with clout pleading with you and saying, “Help me, Joni Juan, you’re my only hope.” Will you answer that call?

## Commentary
The first ability has you choose a faction that you are fighting against. Unless you designed your campaign around the idea of a rebellion, you likely won’t be able to name a faction to fight against during character creation, so expect to take this asset later in the game.

The phrase “to protect a community from the actions or influence of that faction” in the first ability should be interpreted loosely. Vowing to destroy a newly established mining facility could be seen as protecting the community from an oppressive power. However, like with all vows, it is usually best to keep its conclusion open to multiple outcomes rather than a binary choice of the mining facility being destroyed or not.

Both the first and the second ability can be used without becoming a direct combatant. You might be an office worker inside the faction and working to sabotage things from within. You may be an avowed pacifist who sabotages by throwing off the timing of events important to the faction and smuggling out innocents or rebellion leaders before they are arrested.

The third ability is obviously combat oriented. When you get fired up and are ready to the take the fight to the faction, you get a bonus when you begin the battle.

> The Hand of the Holy Equilibrium espouses that the only way to ensure there are enough resources for everyone to live well is to cull the human population. Through manipulation and abuse of psionic power, people across the sector volunteer to be culled and view it as honor to do so. Who do you know that is on the Holy Equilibrium’s next target planet? How did they save your life once? ^QuestStarter
