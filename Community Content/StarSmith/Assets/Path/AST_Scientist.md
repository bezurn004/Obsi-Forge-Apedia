# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Scientist
In the Forge, it seems that the wonders of science never cease. This is partially because knowledge has been widely recognized as the only unending resource available which in turn made going into experimental sciences a very lucrative career choice. Failure is no longer seen as the enemy, but a necessary step on the road to making scientific breakthroughs that not only change the world but also make the parent company a lot richer.

The race for knowledge (and cash) has led to most scientists having an extremely narrow focus for their field of expertise. For example, engineers and maintenance crews are left to be the experts on the Eidolon drive, but a scientist might be an expert on the methods by which an Eidolon equipped ship returns back to normal space after an FTL jump. They figure out how it works, and then the engineers actually make it happen.

Being a scientist is also a relatively safe career even on frontier worlds in the Forge. The narrow expertise makes it hard for a faction to replace a scientist even if the faction doesn’t like the scientist’s results, and competitive factions are reluctant to sabotage or otherwise impede a scientist’s research in the hopes that one day the scientist will work for them.

While many scientists enjoy the daily work of discovery in the lab, there are those few adventurous ones who seek out discoveries through field research. They want to apply their knowledge out in the messy conditions of real life to make sure their discoveries can stand up to the rigors of true application.

## Commentary
This asset is like the original Lore Hunter asset and Gearhead asset combined except that this is more specialized. When you take this asset, you’ll want to think of an area of expertise for your character. You want to pick something that fits the flavor of your character but also is applicable in multiple situations. Having a super-narrow focus is great in the lore (on the previous page), but you might want to be just a bit broader so the mechanics actually happen. Something like “FTL travel” or “Xenovirology” or “Holographic Personality Matrices” is fine.

The first ability here is more action-oriented in that you are making something to help in a specific situation. The second ability is the counterweight to this in that you are digging for info so that you can make a plan at the next step.

For the third ability, I was imagining the trope of trying out a sciency-type thing in a dangerous situation. “Are you sure we can ionize the induction coils to bypass the force field?” “Well, in theory, that would cause more electrons to bond at the circuit point breaking the power flow to the force field. Either that or the force field will explode. Let’s find out, shall we?” Throws the switch

> Balari Gowan is the foremost scientist in the field of black hole gravity waves. She was scheduled to be the main speaker at a conference yesterday but never showed up. Local authorities suspect she was abducted but have no leads. Which faction do you know that is doing experiments with black holes? What dangerous application are they seeking to achieve? If they succeed at their purpose, someone you care about will be put in danger. Who? ^QuestStarter
