# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Linguist
As humanity spread across the Forge, the already diverse languages morphed even further apart. Dialects of the same language would not interact across the cosmic distances for so long that they would become nearly entirely distinct languages with even more dialects on each world or settlement.

Explorers, traders, and governments all recognized the need for accurate translations, and as such, training programs sprung up that installed trainees for years of immersion on worlds that used their chosen language natively. The very best of these graduates continued to shuffle from world to world every five to ten years meaning that by their fifth decade of life, they had accumulated a huge amount of experience with many languages allowing them to express and understand nuances that many academic students would miss.

A further progression of this type of linguistic study integrated the use of obscure grammar rules into encryption methods. It turns out that nothing hides meaning like extreme regional dialects rarely heard outside of their original context. As such, some linguists take up a second career in encryption and secure communication technologies.

While most starships can’t afford to hire a full-time linguist, nearly every major faction employ linguists in nearly all of their missions and transactions. They have found the return on their investment to be worth several times over the initial cost of training.

## Commentary
I really liked the idea of an asset or ability that changed the Ask the Oracle move probabilities. Most actual plays that I’ve seen haven’t dealt with the fact that there are very likely thousands of languages throughout the Forge. Since it would be impossible to know all of them, and equally impossible to know what languages would be helpful ahead of time, I figured you can just Ask the Oracle if you have enough experience with a language to be able to speak it. (Did you ever take Elven as a language only to find out that the whole campaign took place in a Dwarven city? Yeah. Don’t pick languages ahead of time!).

For the second ability, I envisioned this being used kind of like discovering the Rosetta stone. You get small pieces of a language from which you can eventually extrapolate enough other pieces to begin primitive communication. From there, it’s just a matter of time to learn the whole language. Alternately, you might notice an encryption based on a weird quirk of one of your known languages. Not only does this help you immediately, but gives you some narrative direction since you now have a direction to go when exploring the person who wrote the cipher.

The third ability is meant to represent you giving a rousing speech that draws upon certain well-known or highly impactful stories or idioms. “Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.”

## Quest Starter
> A powerful all-frequency broadcast has been received from within a dark nebula. The words are from an unknown, and so far indecipherable, language, but they clearly carry emotions of fear and pleading. What ship was lost in this nebula years ago, and who did you know on that ship? Why do you feel compelled to mount a rescue mission despite not knowing the language?> ^QuestStarter
