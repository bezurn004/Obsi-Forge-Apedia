# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Security Guard
At one point, people speculated that all security guards of the future would either be drones or cybersecurity experts and thus be digital in nature. However, whether ancient talismans protecting warriors from monstrous creatures or knights protecting their king, security has always had a physical component, and today is no different.

The difference is that in today’s world, security guards need to be trained and equipped to handle a larger variety of threats. They could be dealing with an android fighter that has many times their strength, defending from a swarm of drones with the advantage of numbers, or turning away sycophants who would use and abuse their client. A security guard must be ready for any eventuality.

To prepare for such threats, security training schools have popped up across the Forge but none as successful or well-regarded as the Sapphire Anqa. Known for their four-pronged approach to security, graduates of the Sapphire Anqa are in high demand and fetch the highest compensation rates. Many factions will flat out lie and say their facilities are protected by Sapphire Anqa guards just to reduce the chances that a criminal will attempt to steal their goods or resources.

One of the most useful tools a security guard has is their intuition for danger. It is said that the Sapphire Anqa are able to read the hearts of human and beast alike as portrayed in the now legendary story of Sa’lim Fazran stopping a rockhorn mid-charge to protect his young ward and crown prince.

## Commentary
The first ability gives you a bonus add value that can be used six times in total over the course of completing a protection vow. The idea behind this is to incentivize taking risks for whatever it is that you are protecting. If you feel like this doesn’t last long enough, you could add a recharge rule that lets you add +1 to the die value if you successfully Sojourn in the presence of your charge.

Some may argue that the second ability is better covered with Gain Ground or React Under Fire, but this is meant to be physical in nature. It’s actual fighting and combat, and therefore I believe Strike and Clash are better suited.

The third ability gives you a method to Gather Information with heart rather than wits. You rely on your well-trained and well-developed sense of intuition. I imagine a scene where someone is trying to sweet talk their way in to see your charge, and you can tell right away that something is off. The +2 momentum along with an add +1 may sound like a huge reward, but remember it’s only if you actually uncover a threat. When you successfully Gather Information, you could just as easily find out that there is no threat at all.

> A faction with a penchant for shady technology development has just hired Sapphire Anqa trained guards to protect a warehouse near the local starport. The authorities suspect a dangerous new technology is about to be delivered into the wrong hands but don’t have evidence to act. Why are you eager to volunteer to find out what is in the warehouse before it’s too late? ^QuestStarter
