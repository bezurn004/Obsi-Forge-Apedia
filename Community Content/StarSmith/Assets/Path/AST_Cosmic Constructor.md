# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Cosmic Constructor
Cosmic radiation and other forms of background energy are a near constant anywhere in the Forge, and it is rumored that some have mastered the art of tapping into this energy with fantastical results. Stories abound of those who wield light as if it were a physical force of nature.

While these tales may sound fictitious, there has been speculative science as to how these abilities could theoretically work. Those who investigate the claims of light wielders say that it is simply a matter-energy conversion happening. While science has found it easy to unleash the destructive force of turning matter into energy, the true holy grail has been harnessing the ability to turn energy into matter, and light wielders are purported to be able to do just that.

If these cosmic constructors are real, their abilities manifest in vastly different ways across practitioners. Most are said to make bright yellow constructs of light, like the color of a common star, but others have claimed to have seen green, purple, blue or red colors being projected by a light wielder.

In addition to simple cosmetic differences, some users of this power are said to be able to make intricate shapes with their ability, like a giant fist used to punch combatants, while others are said to only make basic shapes, like hexagons or circles or swords made of pure light.

Whether any of these stories hold truth has yet to be determined conclusively, but there is no shortage of unverified sightings of these cosmic constructors across the Forge.

## Commentary
The big idea behind this path is simply making hard light shapes. You start off with basic shapes and expand as you upgrade, but there should be a plethora of ways to use this ability even with basic shapes.

You could be like Ms. Marvel and cast discs in front of you to walk through the air, or you could have a ring that lets you form projections much like a Green Lantern. You could even make a light saber if you want, but the energy use has a limit. Each time you make a move aided by it, you’re losing energy, so you likely won’t make it through a whole battle with energy to spare if you Strike with it every time.

In my head, I was imagining things like making a giant wall of light to block a passageway (hence the picture), constructing a cage of light around an enemy, making an emergency EVA suit out of light, or maybe by the third level creating an intricate replacement part for a machine that will last for a few minutes.

## Quest Starter
> Rumors tell of a cosmic constructor master living within an asteroid belt circling close to dying star. How is this person rumored to have gotten their powers? What dangers now face this light wielder, and what good deed did they do in the past that compels you to go to their aid now? ^QuestStarter
