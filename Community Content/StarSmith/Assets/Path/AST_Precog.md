# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Precog
Precognition was known to be total fiction until our people arrived in the Forge. Some say precognitive abilities developed because of the extreme survival conditions the people experienced on the first iron homes, and others say it was exposure to an energetic rogue comet that has not been seen since. Whatever the cause, we know that precognition is now truth.

At first, it was thought that precogs were able to see far into the future much like the prophets and seers of old, but as far as we can tell, that’s not how it works. It’s more like a sixth sense alerting the precog of danger a split second before disaster strikes. While not as far-reaching as the abilities of a prophet, this danger sense makes for formidable fighters.

Many of those with precognitive abilities become infiltration specialists as they are adept are getting out of dangerous situations quickly and with minimum casualties. They know when a bomb is hidden and about to go off or when a set of blast doors are about to slam shut. Even the few heartbeats they can see into future provide the critical information necessary to make wise decisions in a split second. While these abilities are powerful, there is a natural limit to their uses because they drain the body rapidly of energy meaning that a prolonged conflict can often negate the use of precognition. While this draining on the precogs is not necessarily a physical ailment, it’s like the momentum has been drained from the person.

## Commentary
This asset is modeled after the original Looper asset, but is more like having a Spidey sense all of your own. The first ability is defensive in nature. When you’re in a bad spot and on your heels, your precog abilities kick in to get you back in control. However, there is a cost to pay in the loss of momentum.

The second ability is offensive in nature, the counterpart to the first ability. You can anticipate how your opponent will respond to your attacks and adjust accordingly. If they are going to pull up their energy shield to block your light saber, you can quickly switch to a leg sweep.

The third ability is cool because it switches the values of the possible outcomes on Secure an Advantage. You’re basically more likely to hit with the add +2 but you can only get a +1 to momentum so that you can’t spam this over and over again. You’ll always be draining momentum to use this ability. The killer combo would be following the Secure an Advantage with a move that builds back momentum. Also note that this ability doesn’t have to be used only in a fight.

## Quest Starter
> A notorious spy and assassin is said to be on the way to infiltrate the headquarters of a faction you are associated with. They have asked for your help in defending the faction leader against this attack. Why are you hesitant to help? What makes you think that things are not as straightforward as you have been told? ^QuestStarter
