# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Path Assets|Path]]: Voidshifter
The Void is home to myriad unknown objects, entities and energies. One such energy travels the cosmos as a bright neon ribbon flowing like a sine wave and has been proven responsible for altering the cell structure and DNA of certain humans predisposed to this mutation. With this new physiology comes the ability to morph ones physical appearance for a short time, but that’s only for the ones who survive the initial onslaught of energy.

The first time this energy ribbon was encountered, none survived. Ship’s logs show the captain and chief medical officer racing against time to stop their bodies from, in essence, slowly melting off their frames. We now know this is what happens when a human’s particular DNA cannot handle the morphogenic changes induced by the energy ribbon.

For those that do survive this change, their bodies gain the ability to change shape and appearance. The longer someone works to master this new skill, they better they get at it. While this does sound like a superhero-like trait that would be desired, no one goes out looking to gain shapeshifter abilities because over 99% of the people who encounter the energy ribbon don’t survive.

At first, clandestine and surveillance operations were happy to utilize this ability for their own ends, but after the first few recruits caused havoc impersonating generals, high priests, and others, most organizations keep voidshifters around only to be able to track them more easily. They are often given desk jobs from which they are never unshackled. Due to this, most ships that encounter the energy ribbon strip the data from their logs as soon as possible so that they are not reported and screened for the voidshifting ability.

## Commentary
Overall, this asset is meant to be a little more Mystique and a little less Venom. By that, I mean that I envisioned this being about changing from a human looking one way to a human looking another way. I don’t think it allows you grow larger, smaller, or thinner like Mr. Fantastic.

Note that the shapeshifted form does not last indefinitely. I left the time limit intentionally vague as a “short period of time” so that you can use this as a dramatic failure if you’d like.

While the second ability is meant to be a direct boost to combat, I still don’t necessarily envision it as a full Venom-like transformation. I don’t think your arm turns into a blade or hammer. Instead, I think you can temporarily increase the density of your bones or ratchet up the tension in your tendons to make you stronger, faster, and generally more athletic. The limit on this ability is based off of the number of uses.

The third ability is meant to be a bit more subtle. Like your lungs gaining better filters to help you survive toxic gases, your skin tightening to help you survive in the vacuum of space a few seconds longer, or your circulatory system helping to distribute and regulate heat better as your ship heats up near a star. In my mind, this is an almost automatic response of your body in times of danger rather than something planned or practice.

## Quest Starter
> The voidshifter energy ribbon just traveled through the Xorian sector where the starship Y’nidia, transporting four families to a newly built space station, was caught in its path. The Y’nidia’s last broadcast was an SOS that their ship could not jump away in time, so they would try to launch life boats and spread out in hopes of saving some from the ribbon. Who do you know on the Y’nidia? ^QuestStarter
