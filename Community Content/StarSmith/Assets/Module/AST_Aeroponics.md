# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Module Assets|Module]]: Aeroponics
It turned out that large tanks of water traveling at FTL speeds played havoc with the inertial dampening systems. That meant that our main water supplies in Eidolon-equipped vessels had to be spread out and compressed through tons of piping throughout the ship. This also made hydroponics a less practical option for growing fresh food aboard ships than aeroponics.

Not only are the misters of an aeroponics bay more efficient for water usage, but they were an excellent model used to get the first space showers to happen. Any time one system can be used in multiple places it is good because it leaves more space to house secondary, tertiary and emergency systems.

The aesthetics of an aeroponics bay can also double as a hanging garden or arboretum. This provides a pleasant atmosphere and the smells of growing plants allowing the weary traveler to get a little taste of being planetside while on a long journey.

## Commentary
I used the term “high yield” in the first ability to get across the idea that there is enough food produced that you can afford to trade it with settlements that may need fresh veggies or fruit. In an effort to discourage abusing this ability, I added the fact that it takes time to regrow enough food for trading. That’s a big hit to your food stores after all!

The second ability gives you a bonus to Hearten in the garden. I was imagining Saru tending his plants in his private quarters on the Discovery and the peace that this brought him.

For the third ability, I wanted something that would drive some story components. What if you found a way to grow some crazy powerful plant like the heart-shaped herb in the Black Panther movies? I was imagining going on a quest to find this special herb and then taking the final ability of this asset with the XP awarded from that vow. This not only gives you a vow to go after, but it can drive the story in other ways. For example, once word gets out that you found a way to cultivate this plant, your ships becomes more of a target for the thieves, raiders, and corporate greed machines. You may be able to do something magical with this herb, but it has painted a large target on your back.

## Quest Starter
> The ship known as The Green Seed was one of the original botanical iron homes carrying a plentiful catalog of plant species when we migrated to The Forge. While it went missing during the exodus event, rumors have been popping up of a drifting derelict that matches its description. What plant of now mythic proportions did it house? What need do you have of this plant? What dangerous faction or faction agent is also after it? ^QuestStarter
