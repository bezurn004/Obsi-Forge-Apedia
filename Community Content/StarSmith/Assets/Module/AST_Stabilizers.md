# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Module Assets|Module]]: Stabilizers
Ship stabilizers were always necessary components of starships as one of the first problems that needed to be solved when traveling even at sublight speeds was how to handle micro-particles that hit the ship. A single hydrogen atom hitting on the bow of a vessel traveling at a high enough speed was like setting off a nuclear explosion. Solving that problem led to the invention of tractor beams, but more specifically, it led to a deflector array mounted at the front of the ship designed to push floating space particles out of the way of a swiftly moving vessel. This set of upgrades allows for even more safety aboard a command vehicle by moving larger pieces of matter out of the way like asteroids, comet trails, or even orbital debris from destroyed vessels or equipment.

Inertial dampeners were one of the next inventions created in order to allow ships to enter and exit FTL speeds without all of the ship’s occupants splatting against the interior hull. While this paved the way for the Eidolon drive in the first place, upgraded inertial dampeners can apply that same technology to the whole ship allowing the vessel to absorb larger shocks or forces emitted from solar winds, nebular weather, or even supernova shockwaves.

The top of the line systems can create isolated gravity bubbles around a vessel to protect it from the shearing gravitational forces of ultra-dense stars and close encounters with a black hole. The exact science of this method is still not fully understood, but it is theorized that it works similar to a warp bubble. This hypothesis does have some evidence to support it as ships with malfunctioning graviton fields have either disappeared only to reappear crushed, warped to a nearby gravity well instantly, or even vanished entirely.

## Commentary
The first ability is not to be used all the time. Yes, there’s always tiny debris in space, but this is meant to be used for more significant chunks of debris like an asteroid field you found while exploring a waypoint or a debris-strewn graveyard of destroyed vessels you come across in your travels.

The second ability is meant to be more broad than the first and apply to any environmental factors found out in space, but it wouldn’t help during an attack as that is not an environmental issue. If a space whale created a huge eddy of solar waves or a nebula you were cruising in had acidic gases, then you would likely get the bonus from this asset.

The third ability is meant to be defensive in nature only. Yes, you might be able to Secure an Advantage by sneaking up closer to a star, but these gravity compensators would really only allow you to position yourself in the narrative rather than actually add a bonus for that. I guess you could make an argument that this might help you escape a tractor beam but only if the tractor beam was gravity-based and only if you were on the defensive (i.e. using Face Danger). #ambiguous _Would also propose this could help with encounters such as Gain Ground or Secure an Advantage by positioning ship away from dangerous gravity field_


## Quest Starter
> A crew of four young cadets were headed off for their first solo mission to map a stormy nebula. For unknown reasons, their tiny shuttle went too deep into the nebula and became trapped in the swirling currents and storms. A rescue mission has been mounted, but larger vessels have too big of a profile to survive the conflicting nebular winds without upgraded stabilizers, and the closest vessel with stabilizers is days away. Which cadet do you know who was on this mission, and why are they important to you? What makes you suspicious that being pulled in the nebula may have been intentional rather than an accident? ^QuestStarter
