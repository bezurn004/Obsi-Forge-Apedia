# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Module Assets|Module]]: Tractor Beam
The tractor beam, short for “attractor beam”, is another engineering marvel that has become so commonplace as to be taken for granted, but this technology is far from ordinary. Understanding the physics of tractor beams did not occur until a relatively short time ago. In other words, it was far easier for civilization as a whole to migrate to the Forge than it was to get tractor beams functioning. While the concept had been in science fiction for centuries, it wasn’t until humans mastered micro-gravity waves that this breakthrough technology saw regular use.

In general, radial pulses of gravity waves are projected along a hyperbolic plane around the outer edges of the target. As the waves curve around the back, they pick up speed much like a sling shot maneuver. This creates a tiny bubble around the object with faster gravity waves coming from behind. From there, it is simply a matter of pressure. More force from behind and less in front actually pushes the target towards the tractor beam’s origin rather than pulling it. This process does ensure that tractor beams work smoothly on their target, but it can also be terribly slow at times.

While this technology has mainly be used with peaceful intent, it is true that some have found ways to weaponize it by either overloading the circuits causing multi-vector gravitic forces to push the target in multiple directions at once or by reversing the polarity of the beam (a much safer course for the origin vessel) thereby creating a swift “punch” of gravity.

> [!info] Ability 2
> - [ ] As above, but add +1 to the move as the beam splits into several smaller beams for finer manipulation of smaller objects. ^Ability2
___
> [!todo] Ability 3
> - [ ] When you take a minute or so to invert the polarity of your tractor beam and charge it, roll +integrity or +wits.
> - On a hit, the beam is reversed and charged, and it may be released in a single blast.
> - On a weak hit, as above, but it takes time. [[SF_CH3_Lose Momentum|Lose Momentum]] (-1).
> - On a miss, the charge fails and you must [[SF_CH3_Withstand Damage|Withstand Damage (move)]] (-2). #ConvertAbilityToMove 
> If you make a move to push a foe or obstacle away by releasing the charge, take an automatic strong hit.

## Commentary
The first ability is meant to be used in a careful and calculated manner. For example, capturing an icy asteroid and towing it to a mining colony station that is in need of a source of water or grabbing a single space mine and moving it without it blowing up your ship. There is no add on this ability because you gain the narrative positioning of having the tractor beam.

The add comes with the second ability where you get multiple beams which can be used to more precisely target an object, target multiple objects, or narrow their field to get even smaller objects. For example, I was imagining using these more narrow beams to rescue workers who had become untethered while performing maintenance on a space station or hurriedly grabbing crew members who had been ejected during a hull breach.

The third ability is like a giant battering ram. However, it can take its toll on your ship if you’re not careful.

In general, my intention was that the tractor beam could not be used on objects that were the same size or larger, only smaller targets.

## Quest Starter
> A science vessel observing a local black hole was knocked off course when a large vessel exited the black hole and warped away with a powerful engine of unknown design causing rippling waves of energy across the sector. The science vessel is now caught on the edge of the event horizon and cannot escape under their own power. If enough starships coordinate their tractor beams, it may be possible to save the science team. What else was this science studying near the black hole? How did that large vessel escape the black hole themselves? Where is the vessel now headed that has a certain faction panicked? ^QuestStarter
