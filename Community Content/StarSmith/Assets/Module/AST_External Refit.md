# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Module Assets|Module]]: External Refit
They say you can never be too prepared. That’s why superior command vehicles are outfitted for atmospheric flight, planetside landings, and interstellar journeys. However, some starships go the extra mile and do a full external refit. After all, most spacers only have one starship, and it has to fit all their needs.

For starters, a full refit reinforces the hull which allows it go from the low pressure environment of space to the high pressure environment of underwater. The engines are also converted into ionized plasma jets which can fire underwater and have a near 100% efficiency rating so as to not contaminate the seas. While the ignited plasma flash-boils the immediate water, the stream of the jets is so tightly controlled as to allow precise mobility and limited effect on overall ocean temperatures.

However, oceans aren’t the only place vessels need to go. Space itself can be a dangerous environment beyond the pure black void and lack of pressure. Plasma storms, corrosive nebula gases, lethal levels of radiation, and micrometeorite showers can all be mitigated with the proper shielding and multi-layered iron plating.

The most advanced starships can actually transform into whole new vessel profiles with the help of modular nano-systems. This allows the ship to adapt to dangers or environments on the fly without the need for sitting in drydock. While it normally takes a good hour for a ship’s transformation to complete, there is an emergency protocol that allows it to complete a full transformation within seconds. This swift transforming risks burning out the power core of a vessel and damaging key systems, but many have found it useful in a pinch.

## Commentary
Yes, there’s a Submersible asset in Sundered Isles, and yes, I put my own version of a submarine in this list of assets, but what if the whole ship could be your submarine?! I loved the shot of the Enterprise coming up out of the water in the second reboot film, and now you can recreate that magical moment with the first ability here.

The second ability helps with facing space environmental dangers. This may be radiation or other dangerous energies that are swirling out in the void.

Inspired by Star Trek yet again, the third ability is modeled after the Prometheus’ multi-vector attack mode (Voyager) and particularly Booker’s morphing scout ship (Discovery). This lets you change the ship to get a bonus to one stat’s roll, but is detrimental for all other rolls. The list of stats at the bottom of the card are meant to be used with a paper clip for you to mark which stat is your advantaged stat at any given time. Because the transforming can go wrong in lots of ways, don’t forget that you can use a failure in the transformation as a consequence for a miss in almost any move you make with your command vehicle.

## Quest Starter
> The science vessel known as the Chrysalis had its morphing matrix go out of control. It is now switching rapidly between all of its different modes and making random Eidolon jumps when it hits its speed profile. The crew on board is sending out an SOS whenever they are not jumping, but no ship has been able to mount a rescue in time because of how quickly and randomly they make the next jump. Who do you know aboard the vessel that is important to you? What strange or dangerous research was the vessel rumored to be undertaking when this disaster struck? ^QuestStarter
