# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Deed Assets|Deed]]: Traveler
In the desperately few historical records that exist from our time before the great exodus to the Forge, there are mentions of an almost faith-based belief in the multiverse. Before holo-vids, whole stories played out in flat-screen entertainment called movies about alternate realities and timelines coming into conflict. These myths actually weren’t far off the truth. The multiverse is real, but what the stories didn’t explain was how dangerous interactions between these multiversal realities is.

According to our top scientific minds, the amount of energy needed to travel between universes is on an order of magnitude beyond all but the most unusual coincidental catastrophic events that release large quantities of energy. For example, it might take a ping pong effect of ten or more supernovae cascading into a wormhole at the same time a sector-wide ionic storm rages in a nebula on the other side of the wormhole. To then travel across time takes even more energy. This level of energy can be enough to fracture the very structure of the multiverse.

There are stories of people who wield the fantastic ability to jump between worlds, but the laws of nature fight against interference of in the natural order. Each of the infinite branches of the multiverse want to stay as their own separate branch, and when they collide or collapse together, there are dire consequences for both realities.

These dangers haven’t stopped those we call travelers from using their gifts. Famously, four travelers showed up at the Crumpled Heap telling how they had traveled back from the future to stop the universe’s destruction, and as they were telling the story, they simply faded from existence. Mass hallucination, or truth?

## Commentary
The first ability represents the dangers of messing with alternate realities. What a crack in the multiverse looks like is completely up to you, but it should be pretty bad. However, I added the term “localized” to denote that it doesn’t destroy the whole universe (unless you want it to).

The second ability has you use the first ability from the original Seer asset, but you frame it in a slightly different way. Instead of a prophetic dream, you get a glimpse of a potential future timeline. Much like Dr. Strange looking ahead in the Infinity War, you can search timelines for probable outcomes and use that knowledge to stay the course and avert disaster.

The third ability is another exact copy but this time of the original Looper asset. You can link yourself to a specific time and then travel back to that specific point in time, but it gets harder the further away you are from it. The only thing I changed was letting you jump back farther in time up to years.

While the second and third abilities don’t technically add to clock from the first ability, you should feel free to do so. Just be aware that adding to the clock more often would give you lots of cracks pretty quickly.

## Quest Starter
> A lone pilot has arrived out of Eidolon space in an unusually designed starship claiming that another cataclysmic event like the one that caused the great exodus to the Forge is coming and that the only way to prevent it is to align action steps with that of a parallel universe. What do you notice about this pilot that gives credence to their tale? Who is this pilot a carbon copy of that you have known from this reality? ^QuestStarter
