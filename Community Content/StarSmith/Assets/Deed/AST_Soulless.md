## Commentary
This asset started off as the mirror image of the original Revenant asset, but took a darker turn. It’s now an asset that can be used to turn your character into an anti-hero like the Punisher. You’re still going after the bad guys, but you’re going about it in a very dark way.

Where Revenant used spirit as a way to fight off death, I wanted this asset to use health or iron as a way to fight off desolation. The first ability does this in the exact same way as Revenant’s first ability.

The third ability allows you to Gather Information +iron but only in darker scenes of suffering. Where this type of situation might cause normal people to lose spirit, a soulless character chokes down their bile, grits their teeth, and bears the suffering. The bonus momentum is not meant to celebrate these scenes, but to represent the soulless moving closer to their goal of hopefully ending further scenes like what is before them.

The second ability represents the anti-hero’s willingness to cause suffering or torment in the name of stopping suffering or torment. For example, say your character has captured a low-level mobster who says if they give up the name of the next goon higher in the food chain, they’ll be killed. A soulless one doesn’t care. They’ll still pressure the mobster to snitch and let them face the consequences

## Quest Starter
> A serial killer is on the loose in Asteri City, but worse yet, a soulless one has decided to take the law into their own hands in hunting down the killer. The serial killer is leaving a trail of bodies, and the soulless is leaving a trail of broken people. They both need to be stopped. Who is the soulless to you that you think you can still bring them back from the depths of their despair? Which victim of the killer did you know, and how did their death impact your future in a dark and unforeseen way? ^QuestStarter
