# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Deed Assets|Deed]]: Immortal Coil
It is whispered about the Forge that the key to unlocking immortality has been found. They say that the perfect fusion of humanity and machine has been discovered and that this technology is only possible through intricate programming of subatomic quantum computing. What are humans, after all, except a jumble of programming that occurs through chemical processes in the body? But if this rumor is true, none have seen the evidence of it yet. 

Through the ages, humans have been able to extend life and the quality of that life through medical treatments, healthy living, and enhanced nutrition, but these methods have yielded diminishing returns for the cost investment. Thus, true immortality began to be pursued through technology like self-replicating nanites. As these experiments progressed to human subjects, world after world and sector after sector placed bans on the research. Humanity was united in the fact that they knew we were never meant to live forever.

Despite that belief, if you ask most people how long they would like to live, the answer is always, “a little longer.” This led to body augmentation that provided physical benefits to those who could afford it and to the rise of the cyborg subculture. The line between legal augmentation and illegal immortality research began to blur which allowed more and more secretive experiments to be carried out and failures to be explained away.

Are we there yet? Did someone truly make the final breakthrough? The leaders across the Forge say no, but the rumors persist.

## Commentary
Maybe this is my wish fulfillment of becoming Data from TNG, but it seems like becoming a living machine is a trope worth bringing to Starforged. As this is a deed, there is an extreme or epic quest that must be fulfilled to make this happen. When gaining this asset, I imagined that the artificial body is unique and cannot be replicated for some sciency reason. If your robot body dies, you die too, but the second two abilities combine to give you effective immortality.

The second ability lets you store your consciousness, your life’s memories and feelings. What originally took an extreme quest can now be done directly on your ship. In addition, you can alter your own memories. I just thought it was a cool story idea and excuse to change your personality if you needed one. Does a memory haunt you and make you hesitate when you should act? Who would you be if you erased that memory? What if you erased all memories of a key relationship? How would that change the way you interacted with them in the future?

The third ability probably stems from the fact that I always end up killing the characters I love. I am way too hard on myself with all the misses I get. This completes the hat trick for immortality, but your ship has to survive for it to work. Also, this should be a good plot hook for future stories. If someone finds out that you have the only functioning simulacrum building and conscious uploading computer in the galaxy, you will become hunted for the tech.

## Quest Starter
> As an immortal machine, you are plagued by thoughts that you are not truly yourself. Are all your feelings just facsimiles of the real thing? What vow can you swear to prove to yourself that you have retained your humanity despite this unique transformation? ^QuestStarter
