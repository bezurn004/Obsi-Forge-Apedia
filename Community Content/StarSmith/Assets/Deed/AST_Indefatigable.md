# [[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]] - [[_STRSM_Deed Assets|Deed]]: Indefatigable
When a command-level vehicle goes down, word usually gets around eventually, but it’s a common enough occurrence that it’s not given a second thought. When a command-level vehicle goes down and the captain survives, that gets a little more traction in the rumor mill. When a command-level vehicle crashes, the captain survives, and then they are granted a new ship, that’s a whole new level. That’s a name that gets known as either an unstoppable force of nature or someone who is bat-dung crazy.

As can be imagined, building a starship isn’t cheap. Anyone who has the gumption and competency to complete a single mission in an order of magnitude that it is able to pay off that debt is usually in a class all their own. Sure, there is always talk of nepotism and unearned favor, but the truth is that usually these people have pulled off a major stunt, a real feather in their cap.

This sort of notoriety can go a long way in providing the social capital needed to leverage certain situations to their favor, but it can still be an albatross at times. Family members of crew that didn’t survive the crash, corporations who had a vested interest in the original vessel, and even surviving crew members can all become antagonistic towards these captains who didn’t go down with their ship. This can lead to confrontations down the road that will complicate almost any mission the captain is now on.

It is said that captains in this position meet once a year at a bar in the Hovinar sector called the Crumbled Heap to commiserate, swap stories, and drown their sorrows. It is also said that if you want a job done right, go to the Crumbled Heap on the 53rd day after the Forge New Year and find the captain deepest in their drink.

## Commentary
The first ability grants your character some minor celebrity status that they can leverage to get what they want. This started off as only working when rolling +iron, but I realized that the celebrity status would really work in any situation. The second ability is about either pumping you up or pumping the crowd for information. Either way, it takes a successful Sojourn to activate. I would also consider limiting this to one use per community or at least giving it time to recharge when used in the same community. I don’t think you could go night after night to the same dive bar telling the same story and get the same reaction each time. “Did I ever tell you about the time my ship blew up?” “Yes! Please don’t tell us again!” The third ability represents your character capitalizing on what they learned from the experience of losing their ship. They now are more confident in pushing a ship to its limits and are more willing to take a hit in order to build the momentum towards a winning strategy

Now Teff Abob is on a rampage searching for you in order to earn themselves a new ship from an unknown benefactor. Who is Teff’s benefactor that they would send a galaxy-renowned bounty hunter after you, and what did you do to draw their ire? ^QuestStarter
