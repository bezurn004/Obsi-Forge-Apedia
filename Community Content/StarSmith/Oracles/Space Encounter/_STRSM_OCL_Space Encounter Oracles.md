# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Space Encounter Oracles
Use these oracles when you encounter something out in the open expanses of space. Not sure what your starship’s sensors are picking up? Find out here!

These oracles introduce two new notations. The first is the Terminus, Outlands, and Expanse designations. These are for specific regions within the Starforged setting. If you are using these oracles for another game, it is enough to know that Terminus is the safer, more highly populated region and the Expanse is the most dangerous, sparsely populated region with the Outlands in between. Choose your region, then roll for results.

The second notation is the ▶ symbol. When you see this, it means you should roll on the given oracle for the result.

For example, if you roll on Space Sighting and get ▶Planet, you would then start rolling on the Planet oracles to find the true result of your original sighting in space.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Space-Sightings|Space Sightings]]
- **Space Sighting** - The results of this oracle are something you would find within a solar system such as asteroid belts or nebula.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Sector-Name|Sector Name]]
- **Sector Name** - Roll for both a prefix and a suffix to create the name.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Stellar-Object|Stellar Object]]
- **Stellar Object** - The majority of results here are types of stars you might encounter within a sector, but it can also be crazy objects such as a Dyson sphere or ringworld.

## [[Community Content/StarSmith/Oracles/Space Encounter/STRSM_OCL_Space-Fortune|Space Fortunes]]
- **Peril/Opportunity** - At times, you’ll be asked to roll for a peril or opportunity while exploring waypoints.
