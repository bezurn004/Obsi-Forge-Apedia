# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Settlement Oracles
When you encounter a settlement, use these oracles to get more information about it. The oracles include:

## [[STRSM_OCL_Settle-Creation|Creation]]
- **Location/Population** - If you know there is a settlement in the sector but aren’t sure where, use the Location oracle. Note that the Population oracle is split by region.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Settle-Name|Name]]
- **Name** - A basic name generator using spacey names.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Settle-Approach|Approach]]
- **First Look/Initial Contact/Authority** - These oracles give you a first contact situation with a settlement. What do you see from the outside? How does their representative respond to you? What is their authority structure (which can change how you access the settlement)?

## [[STRSM_OCL_Settle-Concerns|Concerns]]
- **Settlement Projects** - If the settlement needs help on something they’re working on, this will tell you that project.

- **Settlement Trouble** - A wrong that needs to be righted. Perhaps you can help?

You also get a brief description of the planet class and a potential quest starter that would work there.
