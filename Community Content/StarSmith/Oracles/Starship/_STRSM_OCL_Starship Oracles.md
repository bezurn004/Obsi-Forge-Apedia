# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Starship Oracles
Use these oracles when you encounter another starship.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Starship-Creation|Creation]]
- **Type** - This gives you general class of a ship and it’s role. Feel free to add an identifier code like a Hunter-1A class as you run into multiples of the same class to give a bit of differentiation.

- **Fleet** - Perhaps you rolled a miss with a match and a whole fleet of ships on an intercept course just showed up on radar. This will give you the nature of that fleet.

- **Name** - Every ship needs a good name! Well, almost. If you want a registry number instead, try the registry oracle.

- **Registry Number** - Create a numeral and numeric identifier for a ship using both challenge and action dice.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Starship-Approach|Approach]]
- **Initial Contact** - What contact with this ship is like.

- **First Look** - The thing you notice first.

- **Mission** - You may not find out this information unless the contact goes well, but it’s here if you need to know what mission the ship or fleet is on.
