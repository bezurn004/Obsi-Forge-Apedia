# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Derelict Summary
When you come across an abandoned location to explore, it is called a derelict.

## [[SF_CH5_Derelict_Create|Creation]] (Ironsworn: Starforged)
- **Location/Type** - Derelicts can be abandoned starships or abandoned settlements that could be on a planet, in orbit, or adrift in space.
- **Condition** - The condition the derelict is in when you first find it.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Derelict-Looks|Looks]] (Starsmith Oracles)
- **Outer First Look** - What you notice from an outside inspection or scan.
- **Inner First Look** - If you go inside the derelict, this is the first thing you notice.

## [[SF_CH5_Derelict_Zones|Zones]] (Ironsworn: Starforged)
- **Zones** - When exploring a derelict, you end up in different zones of the ship or settlement. You first roll for the zone, and then look at the corresponding zone oracle which gives you a general Area that you are in, Features you notice, and a Peril or Opportunity as they are called for.

While I did expand the Outer and Inner First Look tables, I did not expand the Zone tables. Instead, I altered the Zone tables to be for **[[_STRSM_OCL_District Oracles|city districts]]** within a mega-city structure. Youâ€™ll find those oracles in the next chapter
