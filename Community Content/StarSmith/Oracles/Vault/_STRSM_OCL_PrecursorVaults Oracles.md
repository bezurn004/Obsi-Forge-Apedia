# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Precursor Vault Oracles
When you encounter the strange, weird, or mysterious remnants of an ancient alien species, you are encountering a Precursor Vault. Use the tables to explore from the exterior to the interior to the inner sanctum in search of wonders. 

> [!note] 
> Some of the shapes are not immediately recognizable (such as a Kepler-Poinsot shape), but I would encourage you to Google them. They are real shapes and some are quite stunning.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Vault-Creation|Creation]]
- **Location** - If you know you have found a vault in a sector but donâ€™t know where, roll here.

- **Scale/Form/Shape/Material/Outer First Look** - Combine the results from these oracles to get your first understanding of this alien place.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Vault-Interior|Interior]]
- **Inner First Look** - What you see when you first get inside.

- **Interior Feature/Peril/Opportunity** - As you continue your journey ever deeper, use these oracles.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Vault-Sanctum|Sanctum]]

- **Sanctum Feature/Peril/Opportunity** - Once you breach the inner sanctum, use these oracles to finish your exploration.

- **Vault Purpose** - While your character may not know the vault purpose until they are in the inner sanctum or other narratively appropriate time, you might find it helpful to know the purpose of the place as you envision the inner workings of this place.
