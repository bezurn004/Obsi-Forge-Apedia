# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Planet Oracles
When you encounter a planet, roll on these oracles to find out more about it. Start with the Planetary Class oracle below, and then move on to the oracles of that specific planet class. Within the oracles for each class, you’ll find the following:

- **Atmosphere/Life/Settlements** - These tables are not expanded since they are static, so just roll your percentile. Note that the Life oracle is independent of the Settlement oracle meaning that a planet could have no natural life but someone still built a settlement there anyway.
- **Observed from Space** - This is what your ship’s sensors or a just a glance out the window would tell you about the planet below.
- **Planetside Feature** - A general region you might find while down on the planet.
- **Name** - A name for the planet that goes with the general theme of the class.

You also get a brief description of the planet class and a potential quest starter that would work there.

## Perils and Opportunity
These Oracles can be used on any planet type when rolling a match on the challenge dice during your explorations or when narratively appropriate. They are segregated based on if the planet is habitable for life or not.
