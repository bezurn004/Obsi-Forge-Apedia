OracleDescriptor: "Dense forests and tangled vegetation cover more primeval growth from millennia past all over the surface of this planet. Life here is savage and fierce, fighting to thrive and not just survive. What secrets the rain-soaked canopy hides is anyone’s guess, but the diversity of life here suggests there will indeed be secrets."
