## Oracle
Oracle: Planet
OracleFocus: Ice
OracleDescriptor: "A world blanketed in snow, winter has come and never leaves. Vast tundras sprawl across the surface while continent-sized glaciers carve out whole mountain ranges. Even from orbit it is difficult to tell whether one area is a landmass or just a large snowstorm. Parts of the ocean flash froze leaving waves of ice behind."

> It is rumored that this planet houses what some call “living ice” which may be a new state of matter entirely. If this is true, it could mean a step forward in scientific knowledge and revolutionize how water is stored for trips in the Expanse. What faction is trying to keep this discovery unknown and why? ^QuestStarter
