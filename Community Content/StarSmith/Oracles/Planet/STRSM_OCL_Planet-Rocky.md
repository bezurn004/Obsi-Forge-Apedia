## Oracle
Oracle: Planet
OracleFocus: Rocky
OracleDescriptor: "All rocky planets have a metallic core, but the type of rock that dominates on their surface can be silicon-based or carbon-based. Either type of surface can be hostile to life and treacherous to traverse. These planets may be a source of minerals, but the environment is unforgiving."

> The Knowledge Preservation Society attempts to gather knowledge critical to the functioning of society and document historical events in case of another cataclysmic event. They claim to have found a rocky gateway they call the Sentinel of Eternity on the planet below which can send them back in time to prevent the first cataclysm. Why must you stop them? ^QuestStarter
