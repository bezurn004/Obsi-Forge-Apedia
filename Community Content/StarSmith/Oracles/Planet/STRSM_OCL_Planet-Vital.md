OracleDescriptor: "Against all odds, life finds a way. Even in the emptiness of space, tiny pockets of hope can be found, and this planet offers that. Liquid water exists here which has given a chance for both flora and fauna to flourish. If you can’t find exactly what you need here, you can at least find a moment of respite."

## Oracle: Vital Quick Fauna
> [!mechanics]- | Roll > %%GetDice%% | Guidance
> Since this is a vital world, you’ll likely want to generate some lifeforms. For the fauna (animals), you should use the original #incomplete%%Link to starsmith Creatures index%% STARFORGED creature oracles, but I thought it would be nice to have a quick flora (plant ) oracle as well. To use this oracle, roll percentile dice and your action die (D6) together treating the tens digit of the percentile as separate from the ones digit. ^guidance-QuickFauna
