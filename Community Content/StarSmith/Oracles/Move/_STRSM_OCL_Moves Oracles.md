# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Move Oracles
There are a few moves that contain oracles within the move itself that I felt would benefit from having expanded oracles.

They are:
## [[STRM_OCL_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]]
- Getting a result with a match makes it an extreme yes or no, but I like having a partial yes or no answer sometimes known as a “yes but” or “no but”.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Confront Chaos|Confront Chaos]]
When exploring a waypoint and scoring a miss with a match, something campaign changing can happen.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Make a Discovery|Make a Discovery]]
- When exploring a waypoint and scoring a strong hit with a match, something wondrous is discovered.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Pay the Price|Pay the Price]]
- When you experience a negative outcome but aren’t sure what it is, use this move.
