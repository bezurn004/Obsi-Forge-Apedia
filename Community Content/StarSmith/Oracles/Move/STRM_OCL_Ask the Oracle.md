# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]] - [[_STRSM_OCL_Moves Oracles|Move]]: Ask the Oracle
When you need an answer to a yes/no question, use the oracle as given in Starforged which is reprinted below.

## Oracle: Ask the Oracle
This oracle can be used to replace the one provided on [[MV_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Table|Ask the Oracle]].

> On a match, the answer becomes extreme. This means a “yes” becomes what is often referred to as a “yes and” while a “no” becomes a “no and” indicating that you should ramp up the result another notch. 
> 
> Qualified answers of “yes but” and “no but” can be achieved by rolling your action die along with the percentile dice.
> If the action die shows a 6…
> - “yes” answer is unchanged.
> - A “no” answer becomes “no but” which adds a logical narrative qualifier to the result.
> 
> If the action die shows a 1…
> - A “no” answer is unchanged.
> - A “yes” answer becomes “yes but” which adds a logical narrative qualifier to the result.
> 
> A match on the percentile dice supersede the action die roll. ^guidance-STRSM-OCL-OclMoveAskTheOracle
