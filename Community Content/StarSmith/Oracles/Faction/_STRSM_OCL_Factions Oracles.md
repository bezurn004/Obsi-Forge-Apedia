# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Faction Summary
A faction is an organization that wields power or influence over a specific sector or sectors of space within a subset of focused arenas of knowledge.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Faction-Types|Types]]
- **Type** - The Type tells you the general type of organization it is. After you know their type, you then roll on the corresponding oracles.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Faction-Names|Names]]
- **Name** - First roll on the Name Template table to find the pattern that the name takes and then roll the corresponding pieces to form the full name.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Faction-Sway|Sway]]
- **Leadership** - For the Dominion type, you roll on both the **Dominion** and **Leadership** oracles, although I use the Leadership oracle for all factions.

- **Influence** - Tells the generally how far they are able to project their ideals throughout habitats of the Forge.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Faction-Motives|Motives]]
- **Projects** - This tells what the faction has been working on lately.

- **Quirk** - This is some notable behavior that the faction partakes in.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Faction-Relations|Relations]]
- **Relationships** - This oracle can tell you how two different factions relate to one another. Pick two faction and then roll.

- **Rumors** - What the word on the street is about this faction. Rumors can be a good place to get ideas for new vows or missions.
