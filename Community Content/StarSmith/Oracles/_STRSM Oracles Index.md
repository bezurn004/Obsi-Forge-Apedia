# [[_OCL_Index|Oracles]] - Starsmith Expanded Oracles
My goal in creating the expanded oracles presented here was to give more options to the existing oracles. Nearly all oracles now have triple the results where possible. You still roll 2d10 for oracle results but also roll your action die (1d6). Use the table with the corresponding 1d6 result denoted by dice symbols in the tables such as #missingArt D6=1 D6=2 or D6=3 D6=4 or D6=5 D6=6

I prefer larger grain oracles with many options rather than lots of specific oracles with few options. Hence, the expanded oracles you now hold deepen current oracles rather than adding all new oracles.

That being said, there are a couple of oracles that I’ve created and use myself often enough to justify including.

- **Random NPC Conversations** - I like getting a mundane conversation to write out dialogue of fluff. Plus, it may turn out to connect to the story later on depending on dice rolls.

- **NPC Plot Interaction** - I don’t like thinking up plot points for NPCs to give me ahead of time. I want surprise, and this oracle helps me do that. For additional mystery, play in such a way that this information may or may not actually be true. It’s just what an NPC thinks is true at the time, an NPC lie, or some random piece of data pulled from a corrupted data stream.

- **Item of Narrative Significance** - In my Ironsmith supplement, I added a section for Items of Narrative Significance to help with mystery vows. I liked that there were just some random items that you now had to connect to the plot in some way. This helped to send the plot in a new direction, and now those tables tie nicely together with the **STORY CLUE** oracles in Starforged.

Thanks to Shawn’s generous licensing, all the original oracles are included in this book as well. That way you don’t have to flip back and forth between books or PDFs. Thank you, Shawn!
