- **[[STRSM_OCL_Starship History|Starship History]]** - How did you acquire a starship of own?

- **[[STRSM_OCL_Starship Quirk|Starship Quirks]]** - What is an odd and unique characteristic of your starship?

- **[[STRSM_OCL_Sector Trouble|Sector Trouble]]** - Within your starting sector, what trouble is happening that might give you a hook to get involved? This may only be background happenings as you deal with your inciting incident.

- **[[STRSM_OCL_Inciting Incident|Inciting Incident]]** - What specific event is happening right now that you need to deal with? This is likely your first vow other than your overall background vow.

While these oracles are intended for use at the time of character and sector creation, you can use them throughout your campaign.
