> Your ship is an important aspect of your character, and a character in its own right. What does it look like? What makes it interesting or uniquely yours? Does it have any particular quirks? If nothing occurs to you now, you can flesh it out in play, or roll once or twice on the table below. ^guidance-STRSM-OCL-OclCampaignStarshipQuirk
