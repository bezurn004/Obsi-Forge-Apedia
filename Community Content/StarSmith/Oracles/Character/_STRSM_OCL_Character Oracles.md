# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Character Summary
Whether creating your own player character or building an NPC, you can use these oracles to figure who each character is and what makes them tick.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Character-Names|Names]]
- **Name** - There are three oracles for building a name for a character that they go by.
	- Given Name
	- Family Name
	- Callsign 

## [[STRSM_OCL_Character-Approach|Apprach]]
- **First Look** - The first characteristic you notice about this person.

- **Initial Disposition** - Their attitude towards you, at least at first. I’m sure they’ll love you once they really get to know you. You didn’t really mean for that engine core to go critical with their family on board, did you? Nah… 

## [[STRSM_OCL_Character-Drives|Drives]]
- **Character Role** - The person’s primary job.

- **Character Goal** - The thing that motivates them.

- **Revealed Character Aspect** - As you continue to talk to this person, they show you more about who they are.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Character-Knowledge|Knowledge]]
The following two pages give you a way for NPCs to provide vital plot information without you having to know it ahead of time. Roll on the **TYPE** table and the **TOPIC** table, and then put the two results together to see what the NPC can tell you. If you need help interpreting this information, you may make an **ACTION/THEME** roll or a **DESCRIPTOR/FOCUS** roll. This information could also be something that you find in a database, hacked data-pad, or back channel forum. It doesn’t necessarily have to come directly from an NPC.

- **Random Conversation Topic** - Want to just shoot the bull with an NPC? Roll on this table to see what they want to gab about.

- **Plot Knowledge (Type/Topic)** - Many times you know that an NPC can tell you something important about the plot, but you don’t know what. Roll on the Type and Topic oracles and put the results together to figure out just what this NPC can tell you. Of course, you could use this for when you find information hacking a database as well.
