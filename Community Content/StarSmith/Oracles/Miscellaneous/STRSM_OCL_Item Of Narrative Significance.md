## Oracle: Item of Narrative Significance
> [!mechanics]- | Roll > %%GetDice%% | Guidance
> The **ITEM OF SIGNIFICANCE** tables are meant to go with and complement the [[STRSM_OCL_Story Clue|Story Clue (Starsmith Oracles)]] in that you can get an item around which your clue is centered. Alternatively, you can roll an item first and only roll the clue it represents later when you have narrative positioning to do so. ^guidance-STRSM-OCL-OclItemofNarrativeSignificance
