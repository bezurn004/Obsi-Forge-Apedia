# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Miscellaneous Oracles
A few additional oracles exist that don’t quite fit in other categories. These include:

## [[STRSM_OCL_Story Complication|Story Complication]]
- When something goes wrong but you’re not sure what, roll here.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Story Clue|Story Clue]]
- Similar to my NPC Plot Knowledge oracles, these clues can be found to push you further along in your plot.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Item Of Narrative Significance|Item of Narrative Significance]]
- Pair this with your Story Clue to see what led you to the clue or just grab an Item of Narrative Significance by itself and discover how it connects to the plot as the story continues to unfold.

> The **ITEM OF SIGNIFICANCE** tables are meant to go with and complement the **STORY CLUE** tables in that you can get an item around which your clue is centered. Alternatively, you can roll an item first and only roll the clue it represents later when you have narrative positioning to do so.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Anomaly Effect|Anomaly Effect]]
- When you come across a wild and crazy anomaly, you can use this oracle to see what effect it has on the surrounding region.

## [[STRSM_OCL_Combat Action|Combat Action]]
- Not sure what your opponent will do next? Roll on this oracle to find out.
