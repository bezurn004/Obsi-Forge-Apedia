# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]] - [[_STRSM_OCL_Core Oracles|Core]]: Action/Theme
**Action/Theme** - Roll these when you need to know something that is not physical in nature. For example, you might answer these questions:
	- Why would this character betray their patron?
	- What purpose does this infernal machine serve?
	- What secret is being kept?

## Oracle: Action
This oracle can be used to replace the one provided on [[_SF_CH5_Core#Action and Theme|Action/Theme Oracles]].

> [!mechanics]- | Roll > %%GetDice%% | Guidance
> When you [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] about a goal, situation, or event, roll for an Action and Theme. Together, these provide an interpretative verb/ noun prompt. Other oracles include prompts to check for an Action and Theme (shown as “Action + Theme”). That’s your cue to roll on these tables and interpret the result as appropriate to the situation. ^guidance-STRSM-OCL-OclCoreAction
