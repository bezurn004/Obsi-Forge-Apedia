# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]] - [[_STRSM_OCL_Core Oracles|Core]]: Descriptor/Focus
**Descriptor/Focus**  - Roll these when you need to know something that is physical in nature. For example, you might answer these questions:
	- What is in the abandoned building?
	- What is the raider vessel hauling?
	- What is the nature of this temple?

## Oracle: Descriptor
This oracle can be used to replace the one provided on [[_SF_CH5_Core#Oracle Descriptor|Core Descriptor Oracle]].

> [!mechanics]- | Roll > %%GetDice%% | Guidance
> When you [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] to help define the nature of a location, discovery, or encounter, roll for a Descriptor and a Focus for an adjective/noun prompt. Other oracles will include prompts to check for a Descriptor and Focus (shown as “Descriptor + Focus”). That’s your cue to roll on these tables and interpret the result as appropriate to the situation. ^guidance-STRSM-OCL-OclCoreDescriptor
