# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: Core Summary
The **Core** oracles are the heavy lifters for your campaign. Any time you need more specific details that one of the other oracles can’t provide, you roll on one of these two oracles. “But there are four oracles here?” you may ask. Yes, that is true. However, the **Action** and **Theme** oracles are always rolled as a pair as are the **Descriptor** and **Focus** oracles. Here’s when you use them:

## [[STRSM_OCL_Core Action-Theme|Action/Theme]]
Roll these when you need to know something that is not physical in nature. For example, you might answer these questions:
- Why would this character betray their patron?
- What purpose does this infernal machine serve?
- What secret is being kept?

## [[STRSM_OCL_Core Descriptor-Focus|Descriptor/Focus]]
Roll these when you need to know something that is physical in nature. For example, you might answer these questions:
- What is in the abandoned building?
- What is the raider vessel hauling?
- What is the nature of this temple?

These oracles function quite well on their own to spark your imagination, so if you find yourself overwhelmed with the sheer volume of oracles that Starforged has to offer, just trim down to these. You can answer any question you’ll ever have with these two oracle sets and still not get repeats very often thanks to the expanded tables found here.
