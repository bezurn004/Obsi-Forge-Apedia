# [[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]: District Summary
Districts are sections of a large mega-city which can be explored much like a Derelict or Vault. Characters can easily get lost in the twists and turns of an unfamiliar city, and these districts provide the backdrop for characters to explore.

When you need to see what type of district you are in, you may roll on the table below to get the general theme of the **Zone**. If that is enough to spark your imagination, stop there. If you need more details, you can roll on the corresponding zone oracle.

The only difference from the derelict oracles is that I eliminated the option for “New zone” by itself on the area oracles which allowed for an extra entry in the oracle. Therefore, when you roll the “New zone via **▶[[STRSM_OCL_District-Zone-Access|Access]]**”, you can choose to roll on the Access oracle or not.

Finally, if you need a **FIRST LOOK** oracle, use the one from the **[[STRSM_OCL_Settle-Approach#Oracle Settlement First Look {1-2}|SETTLEMENTS]]** section.
