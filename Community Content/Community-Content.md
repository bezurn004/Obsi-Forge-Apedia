# [[_INDEX|Index]]: Community Content
Work is progressing to import community content from published material and content posted on discord. In general, only content with appropriate licensing or approved by the owners for distribution is included.

## Content 
> **[[_STRSM Assets Index|Starsmith Assets]]** [author: Eric Bright]
> A collection of 32 new assets to incorporate into your _Starforged_ characters.

> **[[_STRSM Oracles Index|Starsmith Oracles]]** [author: Eric Bright]
> Many of the original Oracles from _Starforged_ have been expanded into arrays, greatly increasing the variety in results when making use of oracles to generate content.
