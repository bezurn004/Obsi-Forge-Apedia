# Readme
The Obsi-Forge-Apedia (OFA) is a project to enhance the source material from the Ironsworn: Starforged Table Top Role Playing Game. 

## Dependencies
* Obsidian (https://obsidian.md)
  This repository is created within Obsidian and the files are stored in mark-down, with some HTML tags as well.
- Forge In Obsidian (https://github.com/ericbright2002/Forged_in_Obsidian)
  Initial inspiration was working with Eric's great work with in-line scripts.  Some files share the same name, so full path links are needed.

## How to Use
1. Download the Obsidian app on your computer (so far only used on Windows).
2. Download the Forged-In-Obsidian vault 
	1. (https://github.com/ericbright2002/Forged_in_Obsidian)
	2. Extract the vault
	3. Launch Obsidian and open a vault based on the location of extracted content
3. Download this repository
	1. Extract to a temporary folder
	2. Move the extracted content within the location of the Forged-In-Obsidian vault 
4. Open Obsidian Forged-In-Obsidian and validate OFA content is functional.

## Project Mission
The goal of this work is to digitize the game's documentation into markdown and expand on the below goals:
### Refactor
  The layout and phrasing to be more visually appealing and clear.  Not bound by physical paper, the content should breath more openly.
  
### Refine 
  Add meta-data and dynamic queries and tables to provide enhanced functionality  for running games using Obsidian.
  
### Elaborate
  Answer questions that are ambiguous in the game's material that are open to interpretation or confusing.

The overall mission is to provide an alternative, easier to use, reference material for Ironsworn: Starforged.
