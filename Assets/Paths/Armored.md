### Categories: [[_Path Assets|Path]]
### Character Aspect
If you wear your finely crafted set of personal armor…
> [!warning] Armor Status
> - [ ] Broken
___
> [!note] Ability 1
> - [x] When you [[Face Danger]], [[React_Under_Fire]], or [Clash](z_Obsi-Forge-Apedia/Moves/Combat/Clash.md) against physical attacks or impact, you may put trust in your armor’s strength. If you do, preset your action die to 4. 
> 	- On a strong hit with a match, take +2 momentum as you build confidence, make an impression on your foes, or improve your position.
___
> [!info] Ability 2
> - [ ] You add an important new piece to your set of armor, or upgrade its materials. As above, but preset your action die to 5 instead of 4.
___
> [!todo] Ability 3
> - [ ] When you must [[Endure Harm]], you may instead let your armor take the hit. 
> 	- If you do, roll your action die.
> 		- On a 4 or greater, ignore the harm.
> 		- On a 1-3, ignore the harm but your armor is now broken; you must [Repair](z_Obsi-Forge-Apedia/Moves/Recover/Repair.md) and spend 5 repair points to bring it back to working condition.
