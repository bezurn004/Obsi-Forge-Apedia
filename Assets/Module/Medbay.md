# [[_Assets Index|Assets]]: Medbay
### Categories: [[_Module Assets|Module]]
> [!warning] Module Status
> - [ ] Broken
___
> [!note] Ability 1
> - [x] When you use your medbay to [Heal](z_Obsi-Forge-Apedia/Moves/Recover/Heal.md) yourself or another patient, you may reroll your action die if its value is less than your vehicle’s integrity.
___
> [!info] Ability 2
> - [ ] When you or an ally mark the permanently harmed impact and are brought to the medbay without delay (less than an hour or so), you have a shot at making things right. 
> 	- If you [Heal](z_Obsi-Forge-Apedia/Moves/Recover/Heal.md) and score a strong hit, clear the impact (in addition to the other benefits of the move). Then, envision the scar that now serves as a reminder of the incident.
___
> [!todo] Ability 3
> - [ ] When you [[Face Danger]] by performing a risky medical procedure, or if you [[Gather Information]] through an autopsy or medical examination, reroll any dice and take +1 momentum on a hit.
___
