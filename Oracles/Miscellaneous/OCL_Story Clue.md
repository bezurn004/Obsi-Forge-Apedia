# [[_OCL_Index|Oracle]] - [[_OCL_Miscellaneous|Miscellaneous]]: Story Clue
When you Gather Information to investigate a mystery, you might uncover clues in the form of messages, rumors, eyewitness reports, data, or physical evidence. You can use this oracle to help reveal what this evidence connects to or implicates. Then, use the outcome of the Gather Information roll, strong hit, weak hit, or miss, to guide whether the clue brings clarity or complications.
