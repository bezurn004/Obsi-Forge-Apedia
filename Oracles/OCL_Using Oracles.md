# [[_OCL_Index|Oracles Summary]]: Using Oracles
In Starforged, an oracle is anything that generates random results to help determine the outcome of an action, an aspect of your setting, or a narrative event. Use your preferred prompts while playing the game, or use the wide array of oracles provided in this chapter.

The oracles on the following pages are in the form of random tables, and are customized to the tone, setting, and gameplay of Starforged. Some oracles are for specific, mundane questions to streamline play (“What is the engineer’s name?”). Others provide more abstract results that you interpret based on the current situation (“What goes wrong?”). Perhaps most importantly, there are a variety of oracles in this chapter to help envision what you discover as you navigate and explore the Forge. These range from identifying the nature of a star to generating the forsaken interior of a derelict starship. 

## Oracles in Solo and Co-Op Play
If you are playing without a guide, you can Ask the Oracle and use the tables and generators in this chapter to help reveal details and resolve actions during play.

Keep in mind that Starforged oracles don’t function as a scripted emulator to replace a GM or guide. Instead, they use the power of creative interpretation to help you fill that role. Ask your question, roll on a table, and consider the answer in the context of your current situation and story. What comes to mind first? Did you think of something that reinforces your dramatic narrative or takes things in an interesting and surprising direction? Does it feel right? If so, make it happen.

If you follow your instincts while staying open to twists and turns, you will find your game offering many of the same narrative rewards as if you were playing with a guide. In fact, you’ll be surprised how often a seemingly random result feeds directly into your character’s story and the world you’ve established through play. This is the power of creative interpretation at work.

## Oracles in Guided Play
Guides can use oracles for support during play and to supplement their narrative decision-making. Mundane oracles, such as a ==Character Name (pages 333–335)==, are helpful to quickly flesh out details. Interpretative oracles, such as the ==Action and Theme tables (pages 296–297)==, can be used to spark new ideas.

You can also use oracles as a prompt for sharing control of the narrative with your players. Not sure what happens next? Don’t know how to answer a player’s question? Roll on an appropriate table, or have a player make.

## Summary: Rolling on Oracle Tables
> [!question] **Ask your question and choose an appropriate oracle table.**

> [!oracle] **Roll your oracle dice to generate a number from 1–100.**

> [!abstract] **Check the 1–100 result against the oracle table to reveal the answer.**

> [!danger] **Consider the oracle’s answer in the context of your question and the current situation. Is the result a good fit? Does it trigger a spark of inspiration?**

> [!progress] **If you’ve got your answer, you’re all set! Envision the result and play to see what happens. If you want further detail, talk it out with other players or roll on another table.**

> [!tip] **If the answer is a bad fit for your situation—or if it prompts an interpretation that compromises a player’s comfort or safety—change or adjust it. You can check up or down one row from your original result for another response.**

> [!info] **If you’re still having trouble, roll again, try a different table, or just fall back to your instincts and decide an answer**

## Oracles Tips and Tricks
### Peeling the Onion
The oracles in this chapter often provide layers of detail through multiple tables. For example, the Character oracles (page 330) include several tables to help envision someone’s role, look, nature, and name. It might be tempting to roll on every table at once to generate a more fully formed encounter, but that can slow down your game and work against the opportunity to gain insight through the course of your story.

Do this instead: When initially encountering a place, creature, or person, use the oracle tables only for details you would perceive as first impressions. Make a roll or two, envision the result as appropriate to the situation, make some assumptions to fill in the gaps, and move on with your story. You are playing to see what happens. Think of each roll as peeling a layer of the narrative onion to reveal a new detail.

> [!quote] Narrative Example 
> You encounter another character while exploring a remote planet. To set the stage for the encounter, you use the Character generator and roll on the First Look table. The result tells you that this person is “Wounded” and “Ill-equipped.” You envision someone who was clearly not prepared for an expedition on this perilous planet, and was gravely wounded following an encounter with a native creature. Next you roll on the Initial Disposition table to help envision their reaction. The oracle responds, “Suspicious.”

Over time, you can build on the starting knowledge and [[MV_Ask the Oracle]] to reveal additional aspects.

> [!quote] Narrative Example 
> You manage to gain the trust of this unlucky fellow explorer, and patch them up enough to get them on their feet for a journey back to your ship. Through the course of your interaction, you envision asking questions to learn more about them and their predicament. You roll on the Name, Role, and Goal tables. Taking those responses and expanding on them with interpretation, you conclude that this person is a smuggler, abandoned here and left for dead by double-crossing crewmates. If you end up on a prolonged adventure with this character, you might roll on the Revealed Aspects table to learn more about their personality, quirks, and abilities.

The oracles often include labels that help guide these staggered reveals. For example, planetary aspects are divided into separate tables for Observed from Space and Planetside Feature. With some experience, you’ll develop your own preferences for how and when to reveal new details.

### Inspiration and Randomness
The oracle tables can generate random results, but you’re free to just scan a table and pick an option that is a good fit. This is particularly true when building on established facts and a result is already known to be true. For example, if you’re on a planet and encounter a settlement, you don’t need to roll for a location on the settlement generator; you already know it is “planetside.”

However, keep in mind that the generators—particularly for encounters and locations—are often structured to include a mix of common and rare answers. For example, coming upon a Vital World on a spaceborne expedition is an unlikely and wondrous discovery. Consider these assumptions when choosing or interpreting oracle results.

### Results By Region
Location oracles are often structured with results organized by the main regions of the Forge: Terminus, Outlands, and Expanse. Check the result for your current location. If you are playing in another setting, you can think of those regions as translating to Settled, Frontier, and Uncharted.

### Building Oracle Arrays
The wide variety of oracles in this chapter provide a toolkit that you can use and combine as you like. You’ll often have options for what table to roll on for a specific location or situation. Once you’ve gained some experience using the oracles, check out page 384 for advice on building Oracle Arrays that are tuned to your preferences.

## Common Symbols 
### Multiple Results
Some oracles provide a recommended range of results. This is shown as a looping arrow with the suggested number of rolls. For example: @1–2. Depending on the situation, you might make multiple rolls at once, or make them over time to “peel the onion” and reveal new aspects.

All other tables are assumed to default to a single roll, but some oracles include an embedded result that prompts you to make multiple rolls. This is typically shown as “Roll twice.” If you get this result, roll twice more on the table and combine those results. If you get “Roll twice” yet again, ignore it and redo the roll. 

### Links to Other Tables
Oracle answers will often prompt you to jump to another oracle. This is shown as an arrow symbol with the name(s) of the oracle. For example: >Starship. If you see this prompt, that’s your cue to go to that section or table to reveal more about the encounter. If you are reading this rulebook on a digital device, those links are clickable.

## More Oracle Options

## Oracle Arrays
Starforged oracles offer many options for answering questions and generating locations and encounters. But these options can slow down your gameplay as you consider what table to use for a specific situation.

Don’t get overwhelmed. You’ll soon develop your own preferences. Plus, using established facts and your intuition without needing to Ask the Oracle will keep things moving. But if you want to play with all the toys in the oracle toybox, while leaving some of the moment-to-moment decisions in the hands of fate, an oracle array is your answer.

An oracle array is a collection of oracles you assemble to help answer questions for a specific situation or location.

The key to an oracle array is your six-sided action die. To create an array, you’ll assign the values of that die (1–6) to two or more oracle tables. When you need inspiration for a situation or location associated with an array, roll your action die alongside your oracle dice. This magically transforms your action die into an array die for the purposes of this roll. Check the value of the array die to see what table you’ll reference.

Arrays are an optional tool, but mixing and matching oracle tables within an array will arm you with a rich collection of possibilities. A simple ad-hoc array can be quickly created while making an oracle roll. More complex arrays for a site or situation can be outlined in your journal or on a note card for repeated use.

| Action Die | Exploring the Haunted Derelict |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Haunted Feature |
| 2-5 | Derelict Feature |
| 6 | Descriptor + Focus |


| Action Die | Trouble in the Haunted Derelict |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Pay the Price |
| 2-3 | Haunted Peril |
| 4-5 | Derelict Peril |
| 6 | Story Complication |

> [!quote] Narrative Example
> You’ve traveled to an orbital outpost, and roll a weak hit as you Finish an Expedition. Per that move, you must suffer a complication at the end of the journey. You aren’t sure how to resolve this new trouble, so you consider what oracle table to use for inspiration. The Story Complication oracle would be a good fit. Or you could assign this settlement the Inhabited theme and roll on the Inhabited Peril table. You decide to leave it in the hands of fate with an impromptu oracle array. On a 1–4, you’ll use the Story Complication oracle. On a 5–6, it’ll be an Inhabited Peril. You roll the 6-sided array die alongside the oracle dice. It comes up as a 5, so you check the value of the oracle dice against the Inhabited Peril table.
