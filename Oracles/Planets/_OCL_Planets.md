# [[_OCL_Index|Oracles Summary]]: Planets Oracle
## Exploring Planets
The chart on the previous page provides a simple method of generating a planetary class. If this is enough information, stop there and envision the world as appropriate to its type. For a bit more detail, make a roll on the Descriptor oracle (page 298) and envision how that aspect defines the nature of the planet or a specific planetside location.

### Detailed Planet Generation
Using the planet dashboards on the following pages, you can generate details for the features of a planet if that place has a focus in your story.

Start with the tables that describe features you’d detect at a distance, such as Atmosphere, Settlements, and Observed from Space. Then, if you investigate the planet, roll on the Planetside Feature and Life tables to uncover more about the nature of that place.

If you have advance information on a planet, you’ll have a more complete picture before you travel there. In that case, roll to determine its nature as you like. If you are the guide, assemble the characteristics of a planet as needed.

### Planet Atmospheres
The atmosphere table for each planet type includes a range of results to help you envision a planet’s habitability. 
- None / thin: This planet is airless, or its atmosphere is so thin as to be useless for humans. 
- Toxic: This planet’s atmosphere is not compatible with human life. Exploring this place will require a sealed environment or breathing apparatus. Otherwise, survival is measured in minutes. 
- Corrosive: This planet’s atmosphere is deadly to humans. As a bonus, it can damage exposed skin, materials, plastics, and metals over time. 
- Marginal: It’s unhealthy to breathe this planet’s atmosphere for more than a few hours at a time. 
- Breathable: This atmosphere is not perfect, but it’s good enough to sustain human life. 
- Ideal: This planet’s atmosphere is ideally suited to human life.

### Envisioning Planetside Expeditions
Planets are big. These oracles help set the stage, but won’t provide the moment-to-moment details of a surface expedition. Instead, use the established nature of a planet as a springboard for envisioning terrain and encounters. Save the Planetside Feature table for key aspects. Roll on the [[OCL_Core#Oracle: Descriptor|Descriptor]]  and [[OCL_Core#Oracle: Focus|Focus]] oracles for additional variety. Use the [[OCL_Planet_Peril|Planet Peril]] and [[OCL_Planet_Opportunity|Planet Opportunity]] oracles to help envision the nature of an unexpected event.
