# [[_OCL_Index|Oracles Summary]]: Action and Theme
Use these oracle tables to reveal details about a goal, situation, or event. They provide a word or phrase that can be taken literally or interpreted as an abstraction.

Action and Theme can answer questions such as:
- “What does this character want?”
- “What is this faction’s mission?”
- “What caused the downfall of this settlement?”
- “What is this device’s purpose?”

> When you [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] about a goal, situation, or event, roll for an Action and Theme. Together, these provide an interpretative verb/ noun prompt. Other oracles include prompts to check for an Action and Theme (shown as “Action + Theme”). That’s your cue to roll on these tables and interpret the result as appropriate to the situation. ^guidance-ISSF-Core1-0-OclCoreAction-Theme
