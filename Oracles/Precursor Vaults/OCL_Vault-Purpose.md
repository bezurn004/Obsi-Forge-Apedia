 # [[_OCL_Index|Oracle]] - [[_OCL_PrecursorVaults|Precursor Vault]]: Purpose
Because precursor vaults are alien and enigmatic, understanding their ultimate purpose requires investigation and exploration. Use this oracle to reveal the vault’s original function or role at an appropriate point in your survey. This can come as an outcome of completing an expedition, or when your story naturally leads you to a revelation of the site’s nature.
