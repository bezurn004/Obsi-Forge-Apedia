# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Take Command
In this exercise, you decide whether to explore your character’s progression as a seafarer through the course of your story, or begin in command of an able ship and crew. We’ll also wrap up your character by picking a final asset.

> Allow about 10–20 minutes for this exercise.

## CHOOSE YOUR COMMAND
Select from these three options. If you are playing with allies, pick a command together—irrespective of your individual roles. One of you might take on the position of captain, but everyone helps guide the ship and crew on their way.

> ### OPTION 1: NOVICE COMMAND
> You are in command of a ship, but it is a minor vessel of little repute. This is the default campaign start.
> 
> You are a greenhorn captain or fallen on bad times. Your crew is much like the ship—unremarkable. Some are inexperienced. Some are indifferent. But with time, you may grow to rely on one another. Your ship will come into its own, or you will claim another. Can you forge a worthy legacy among the isles?
> 
> Take the asset card for the incidental [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]]. Decide if it is light, medium, or heavy. If in doubt, make it light and envision it as a small sloop, ketch, or cutter—a nimble but fragile vessel. To learn more about this starting ship, see [[SI_CH1_Your Ship#THE SAILING SHIP|page 17]].

> ### OPTION 2: WORTHY COMMAND
> You are in command of an admirable vessel and able crew. You begin your story with the wind in your sails. Will you hold this ship and crew together amid the perils of the isles?
> 
> Take the [FLAGSHIP] command vehicle asset. This asset is normally gained when you [[SI_CH4_Advance#Advance Move Card|Advance (SI Moves)]] and spend experience. But as a seasoned commander, you skip the queue and claim this prize at the start of your story. Learn more about the [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] asset on [[SI_CH1_Your Ship#YOUR FLAGSHIP|page 18]].

> ### OPTION 3: NO COMMAND
> You do not have a ship or command of your own—yet. If you are a mariner, you serve under the command of a non-player character on their ship, or are stranded or marooned without a ship.
> 
> Or perhaps the sea has yet to sing its siren song, and your adventures are found ashore. You might traverse rugged island landscapes as a guide, skulk among the back alleys of a city-state as a street urchin, or navigate the intrigues of imperial politics as a secret insurgent. 
> 
> Either way, your destiny lies on a seabound course. Will you someday stand at the helm of your own mighty ship?

## SHIP HISTORY
If you have a command, envision how you claimed or earned the vessel. For inspiration, use the table below. If you sail under the command of a non-player character, you can use this table to give their ship a backstory.

| 31–40 | Discovered within a hidden sea cave after calling to you in a dream |
| 41–50 | Found adrift in perfect condition, with no sign of the crew |
| 51–60 | Gifted by a dreadful entity in exchange for a dark favor |
| 61–70 | Granted in an accursed agreement, sealed in blood |
| 71–80 | Improbably found as a derelict well inland; moved and refloated with much effort |
| 81–90 | Raised from the sunken depths as a boon from the sea itself |
| 91–100 | Taken in spite of its cursed reputation, when no one else would sail it |

## SHIP CHARACTERISTICS
Envision the ship’s look and nature. For inspiration, use any of the prompts below. If a rolled response on a table doesn’t fit, reimagine it, reroll, or ignore it and move on.

- **What size is the ship?** Roll or choose once on the [[SI_CH3_Shp Sighting|Ship Size]] table (page 132). Ignore or reroll the “Force” results.
- **What aspects of the ship’s look or nature are obvious when first sighted?** Roll or choose once or twice on the [[SI_CH3_Ship Approach|Ship First Look]] table (page 134).
- **What symbol does it bear on its flag or as a design motif?** Roll or choose once on the [[SI_CH3_Ship Approach|Ship Symbol]] table (page 136).
- **What are less-obvious or hidden aspects of the ship or its crew?** Roll or choose once or twice on the [[SI_CH3_Ship Engagement|Ship Details]] table (page 138).
- **What cargo does it currently carry?** Roll or choose up to three times on the [[SI_CH3_Ship Boarding|Ship Cargo]] table (page 139).
- **What is the ship’s name?** Roll or choose on the [[SI_CH3_Ship Boarding|Ship Name]] table (page 140).

## CREW CHARACTERISTICS
Envision the makeup of the ship’s crew, using the table below for inspiration. Rolling for a result can inspire details for your own background and potential quests—or it may put you at odds with a crew that is contrary to your nature and goals.

| 49 - 54 | Outcasts and exiles, bound by their differences |
| 55 - 60 | Rebels, fighting for freedom |
| 61 - 66 | Refugees from a faraway land, finding a new home |
| 67 - 70 | Religious zealots, serving their god |
| 71 - 74 | Scoundrels and spies, always watching |

| 91 - 100 | Roll twice; these groups are at odds |

For now, focus on the crew as a whole. Later, you can personalize key individual crewmembers. See [[SI_CH1_Command and Crews#LEADING THE CREW|page 22]]page 22 for more on envisioning and managing a crew].

## READY TO CLAIM YOUR FINAL ASSET?
Choose a final asset from these categories: ==Support Vehicle==, ==Module== (only if you command a [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]], ==Path==, or ==Companion==. For the full list of recommended _Sundered Isles_ assets, see [[SI_CH1_Your Characcter#Asset Guide|pages 14-15]].

Do not choose a Deed asset for your starting character. Those represent notable achievements and situations in your story, and are taken when you [[SF_CH3_Advance|Advance (move)]].

If you want to start simple, or you’d like to get a better sense of your character and their challenges before making a choice, feel free to bank this asset for later. Once your campaign is underway, you may claim the banked asset—choosing from the categories listed above—without paying an experience cost.

### CHOOSING CREW-RELATED ASSETS
If you command a crew and want to spotlight your role as their leader, take [[AST_Crew Commander|CREW COMMANDER]] as your final asset. If you command a pirate ship, the [[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]] asset gives focus to the ebb and flow of your fortunes as buccaneers. If you’d rather explore the evolution of your command through the course of your story, save them for when you [[SI_CH4_Advance#Advance Move Card|Advance (SI Moves)]]. To learn more about these command assets, see [[SI_CH1_Command and Crews#CREW-RELATED ASSETS|page 23]].

### SET YOUR REMAINING CONDITION METERS
Set the integrity of your [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]], [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]], or support vehicles to their max value. Also, set your ship’s hold supply to its max value. Finally, if you have a companion, set its health to its max value.
