# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Choose Your Truthes
In this exercise, you set the tone and background for your campaign by deciding the nature of your version of the _Sundered Isles_. These are your truths. When you’re done, you’ll have key aspects of your setting sketched out, and a backdrop of challenges to help fuel your adventures.

> #missingArt [clock] Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise.

## THE TRUTH CATEGORIES
This section includes 11 categories to help envision your version of the _Sundered Isles_. The categories are:

|  |  |
| --- | :---: |
| Sundering | [[SI_CH2_TR_Sundering\|Page 77]] |
| Relics | [[SI_CH2_TR_Relics\|Page 78]]  |
| Modern Era | [[SI_CH2_TR_Modern Era\|Page 79]] |
| Iron Vows | [[SI_CH2_TR_Iron Vows\|Page 80]] |
| Navigation | [[SI_CH2_TR_Navigation\|Page 81]] |
| Empires | [[SI_CH2_TR_Empires\|Page 82]] |
| Piracy | [[SI_CH2_TR_Piracy\|Page 83]] |
| Religion | [[SF_CH2_TR_Religion\|Page 84]] |
| Magic | [[SI_CH2_TR_Magic\|Page 85]] |
| Beasts | [[SI_CH2_TR_Beasts\|Page 86]] |
| Horrors | [[SI_CH2_TR_Horrors\|Page 87]] |

To keep things moving, read the bold text in each category as a rundown of your options. Use or ignore the expanded summaries and quest starters as you like. For more tips on choosing your truths, [[SF_CH2_Choose Your Truths#Tips For Managing This Exercise|see page 83]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook.

Each category also includes suggestions for character assets, marked with a person (![[character.svg|15]]) icon, and potential factions to add to the setting, marked with a flag (![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|25]]) icon. If a recommended asset interests you, or a faction fits your vision for the world, make note of it. In the following two exercises, you introduce factions to the Isles and choose your character assets.

## HOW TO SELECT YOUR TRUTHS
Select your truth for each category in one of three ways. Mix and match these techniques as you like.

> [!success] Pick
> Choose a truth from the three options.

> [!oracle] Roll
> Roll for a truth using your oracle dice.

> [!note] Create
Customize a truth, or craft your own.
