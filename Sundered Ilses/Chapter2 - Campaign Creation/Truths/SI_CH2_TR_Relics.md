What remains of lost or fallen people?

|  | Forlorn Survival |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **The long history of the isles is marked by disaster, war, and exodus. Abandoned and ruined sites are grim monuments to these events.** |
|  | Former communities—even entire islands—are sometimes forsaken by their people. Others are lost and forgotten through the ravages of time. These places echo with the memories of lost lives, but also remind us of the perseverance of those who survived to carry on their traditions elsewhere. |

> Quest Starter: An uninhabited island is marked by the ruins of a once-great city. Someone important to you led an expedition to that island months ago, but has not returned. What were they in search of?

|  | Ruins and Resurgence |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **Two centuries ago, a powerful empire dared to claim these isles as their own. Ruined places are all that remain to mark their hubris.** |
|  | The tattered banners of the fallen empire lie amid ravaged fortresses, wrecked ships, and abandoned cities. In some places, nature reclaimed these sites. In others, people return to build anew upon the graves of these former invaders. Meanwhile, scavengers—like gulls picking at the bones of dead fish—scour the remnants in search of plunder. |

> Quest Starter: The emperor wore a crown adorned with two gems of unsurpassed size and quality: a blue diamond to honor Wraith, and a fiery ruby to represent Cinder. The resting place of the emperor and this crown are a mystery—one you are determined to solve.

|  | Echoes of Splendor |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **An ancient civilization of unfathomable power left its mark upon the isles.** |
|  | These people unlocked secrets beyond our understanding. The ruins marking their legacy are places of unnatural construction, confounding mechanisms, and cryptic relics. Some islanders revere the ancients. Others seek to understand them. A few have more selfish motives—pillaging the sites for treasure and artifacts. But some secrets are best left buried. Many ruins are cursed, corrupted by time, and haunted by malignant evil. |

> Quest Starter: Dozens of ancient towers have flared to life, sending up beacons of light visible from leagues away. These lodestars form a marked path that stretches well beyond the far horizon. Why do you set out to see where this path leads?

![[character.svg|20]] If you are dedicated to searching out mysteries or preserving the legacy of lost relics, you might be a **[[AST_Scholar|SCHOLAR]]**. If you deal in recovered or stolen relics, you might be a **[[AST_Peddler|PEDDLER]]**. If you delve wrecks and ruins to gather resources or riches, you might be a **[[AST_Scavenger|SCAVENGER]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|25]] A society of researchers and archaeologists works to understand lost people and relics. A sacred order of caretakers protects age-old sites from trespassers and grave robbers. An underground ring of fortune seekers supplies a black market trade of stolen treasures.
