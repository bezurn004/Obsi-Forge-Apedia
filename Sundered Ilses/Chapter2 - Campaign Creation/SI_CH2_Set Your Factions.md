# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Set Your Factions
What people and powers inhabit your version of the isles? In this exercise, taking inspiration from your truths, you choose or envision a handful of influential factions.

These choices help set in motion the conflicts and interconnections of your setting, and provide inspiration for encounters at sea and ashore.

As part of this exercise, you’ll want to record some notes. Grab some index cards or notepaper, or open up a new page in your digital journal.

> Allow about 10–20 minutes for this exercise.

## INTRODUCE YOUR FACTIONS
Consider the outcome of the truths exercise. What important or interesting powers come to mind? Is there a single, oppressive empire? Multiple empires? What people and organizations inhabit the isles? Do supernatural forces wield power or authority in your world? For the purposes of this exercise, make note of three or four factions. You’ll encounter other people and powers through the course of your story, but this is enough to get things rolling.

> [!tip] Group Play
> If you are playing with others, take turns suggesting a faction. Use this as an opportunity to discuss character concepts, what brought you together as allies, and
how a suggested faction can tie into your character’s background or motivations.

### RECORDING FACTION DETAILS
Give each faction a name and a short summary with a few commonly understood details. Two to four bullet points are about right. 

> Forsaken Fleet | ORGANIZATION
> - Infamous clan of pirates
> - Led by a marauder known as the Raven Queen
> - Sacked a major port town, and made it a refuge for outlaws and outcasts
> - Ships have black sails

### WANT INSPIRATION?
If you’d prefer to keep it simple, start with a placeholder description—for example, “Tyrannical Empire” or “Undead Pirates.”  If you’d like suggestions for factions, [turn to pages 52–55]. You’ll find brief summaries for factions across four categories: societies, organizations, empires, and the cursed. You can roll for a random faction, pick  from any list, or customize and combine options. Elaborate on your choices as you like, and consider any unanswered questions implied by the descriptions.

Let your selections—even random ones—support your truths in the previous exercise and your preferences for the campaign. If colonial empires are not present in your version of the isles or hold no influence, ignore them. If supernatural forces do not exist, you can treat cursed factions as myths or rumors.

You can also generate details with the [[_SI_CH3_Faction Oracles|Faction Oracles]] (page 176). Or use real-world history, other games, or media for inspiration—adjust and reimagine as needed.

## THE RELEVANCE TEST
For each faction you introduce, answer three questions.
1. Does this faction fit the world I am creating?
2. Can this faction motivate quests, connections, or threats for my character?
3. Can this faction interact with at least one other faction to create conflict or intrigue?

If the answer to any of those questions is “no,” rethink the faction or choose another. If the answers are only a tentative or qualified “yes,” that’s good enough. Let it simmer. You’ll have time to adjust, even once your story is underway.

## DEFINE FACTION RELATIONSHIPS
Now that you have a handful of factions to set loose in your world, you can brainstorm their relationships to help envision opportunities for conflict and drama in your story.

### CONNECT THE DOTS
Take a moment to consider how the factions relate to each other. Are they at war? Allied against a mutual foe? Is one supporting the other—perhaps in secret? For some factions, this might be obvious. An empire is likely in conflict with factions that stand against them. Pirate clans undertake piracy, although they may use discretion when choosing targets. Other relationships might be more nuanced.

Give each faction a relationship with at least one other faction. If you’re unsure, choose two factions, and use the table below to help frame the relationship of one to another. Reroll or adjust any result that doesn’t fit, or consider how that result might signal an unexpected relationship. If you’d like more options, you can also use the expanded version of this table [[SI_CH3_Faction_Type and Relations#Oracle Faction Relationship|on page 177]].

|  |  |
| :---: | --- |
| 1–10 | Antagonistic or at war with |
| 11–20 | Friendly or allied with |
| 21–30 | Holds leverage over |
| 31–40 | Indebted to |
| 41–50 | Maneuvering against |
| 51–60 | Requires support from |
| 61–70 | Shares a rivalry with |
| 71–80 | Shares power with |
| 81–90 | Splintered from |
| 91–100 | Trades resources or favors with |
  
### LINKING FACTIONS TO YOUR CHARACTER
If any of the factions offer a potential backstory, origin, or opposition for your character, make note of it. Factions can help ground your character’s place in the world and motivate them into action. 

### MARK IT DOWN
Add important relationship details to your summary card. Keep in mind that you are only deciding the commonly understood connection between those factions, and that further investigation or events may reveal a deeper or alternate truth.

If helpful, you can create a relationship map for factions as described on [[SI_CH1_Factions of the Isles#FACTION RELATIONSHIP MAPS|page 51]]. But it might be best to save that for later. Let the factions and their relationships deepen through a session or two, and take what you’ve learned to craft a relationship map.
