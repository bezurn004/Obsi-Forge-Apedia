# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Prepare to Set Sail
In this section, you forge a character and your unique vision for the _Sundered Isles_ using a series of guided exercises. If you’re playing _Sundered Isles_ with others, make this a group activity to give everyone a stake and input in the setting.

Remember: Prep is play. These exercises should be fun. If anything feels like work, skip it or take a shortcut and move on.

## CONSIDER THE TONE FOR YOUR WORLD
What sort of adventures do you want to undertake? Swashbuckling action? Treasure hunting? Scrappy, anti-imperial rebellions? Court espionage and intrigue? Spooky nautical exploration? Banishing eldritch horrors? Setting a baseline helps inform your choices in this section. If you’re playing with others, briefly talk it over.

If you’re unsure, the decisions you make in these exercises set your course. But don’t let the exercises undermine your own preferences. This section gives you a true north, but you are at the helm. Steer the ship as you like.

## BUILD A WORLD MINDFULLY
Depending on your choices in these exercises, your version of the _Sundered Isles_ might feature aspects of the real-world age of sail. In popular media, this “age of discovery” is often romanticized. In reality, it was a time of brutal conquest, exploitation, and enslavement perpetrated by colonial powers. 

However, this is your world. You are encouraged to emphasize fun and adventure, but should do so in a way that doesn’t reinforce the harmful ideologies and stereotypes of our own history. Consider the following:

- **Prioritize diversity.** There are no setting assumptions that constrain your depiction of race, culture, disability, sexual  orientation, or gender identity. Envision a world of vibrant possibilities.
- **Reject the narratives used by colonizers to dehumanize indigenous people.** Do not depict any indigenous culture of the isles as monolithic in their values or as universally good or evil. Do not portray them as inherently primitive, strange, or magical compared to “default” identities.
- **Resist injustice.** If imperial forces have a role in your setting, they build their wealth, strength, and influence through exploitation and oppression. In their arrogance, they claim discovery and dominion over lands long-known and long-inhabited. Make no mistake—they are the enemy. Your character is not another cog in the colonial machine. You are meant to break the machine.
- **Carefully consider the representation of slavery in your campaign.** The slave trade was an abhorrent reality of the colonial age, but is not assumed to be an aspect of the _Sundered Isles_. For you or another player, any depiction of slavery may be harmful or unwanted content. Discuss this in the context of your worldbuilding and [[SI_CH4_Set a Flag#Set a Flag Move Card|Set a Flag (SI Moves)]] as needed. If slavery is a reality in your setting, do not trivialize or romanticize it.

## SUPPORT PLAYER SAFETY
As you work through the campaign launch exercises and anytime during play, use the [[SI_CH4_Set a Flag#Set a Flag Move Card|Set a Flag (SI Moves)]] to identify content boundaries and to prioritize player safety, comfort, and fun over the narrative. This can include content that will be omitted, modified, or addressed on a case-by-case basis if it is encountered in your game.

Work with other players to ensure a collaborative environment where everyone can [[SI_CH4_Set a Flag#Set a Flag Move Card|Set a Flag (SI Moves)]]. But keep in mind that using this move should not force a discussion of a content boundary. Players do not need to provide details or justification. If that is their wish, note the flagged content and move on.

### USING OTHER SAFETY TOOLS
You might find that the Starforged session moves don’t fit the needs of your table. Each person is unique in what safety tools work for them, and many other safety tools address this variety of needs.

You can explore resources like the TTRPG Safety Toolkit to find safety tools that work best for you and your game. The TTRPG Safety Toolkit, curated by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk, is a compilation of safety tools designed by members of the tabletop roleplaying game community. You can find it here: bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit.

> ## WANT A QUICK START? 
> If you already have some idea of the setting, tone, and starting situations for your campaign, or if you are returning to an existing world, you can skip most of these exercises. Instead, do only the following:
> 
> - Create your character using the exercise [[SI_CH2_Create Your Character|starting on page 90]].
> - Choose your command using the exercise [[SI_CH2_Take Command|starting on page 96]].
> - Play! You can sort out the rest through the course of your story.
> 
> Otherwise, if you are starting with a clean slate and want to set the stage for your adventures, turn to the next page to get started.
