# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[SI_CH2_Chart Your Course|Chart]]: Set Faction Influence
The navigation chart worksheet includes a ==faction influence grid==. This tool helps manage the presence and dominance of factions in your starting area. Once your campaign begins, it can reveal the nature of encounters with ships and settlements.

Check your faction notes from the [[SI_CH2_Set Your Factions|faction exercise]] (page 88). Which factions do you envision as having a role in this area? Choose a field of the grid for  each of them, using whichever rank seems most appropriate for that faction’s role in the area and your story: dominant, established, subsisting, diminished, or obscure.

Leave several slots blank. New factions can emerge in the course of your story.

Later in this exercise, you reference this grid to decide which factions have control of a key settlement. To learn more about the [[SI_CH1_Factions of the Isles#FACTION INFLUENCE GRID|faction influence grid]], see page 50.
