# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[SI_CH2_Chart Your Course|Chart]]: Build a Seaside Settlement
> ### [[_SI_CH3_Settlement Oracles|SETTLEMENT ORACLES]]
> Page 164

In this step, you generate a settlement—a populated village, town, or city—as a hub for the start of the campaign. Settlements are located throughout the _Sundered Isles_, but tend to be sparser and smaller beyond the Myriads. Some settlements are as old as memory, and others are newly founded.

Answer the following questions to introduce the local settlement. This settlement might be an important location in the area, your homeport, or simply a potential destination as you make your way into these waters.
- **Where is the settlement located?** Pick an island and mark a location for the settlement along the shoreline.
- **How populous is the settlement?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Settle-Creation#Oracle Settlement Size|Settlement Size]]_ table (page 164).
- **What are the primary industries or activities?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Settle-Focus and Details#Oracle Settlement Focus|Settlement Focus]]_ table (page 168), referencing the shore column.
- **Who is in control here?** Check your faction influence grid, and choose a controlling faction. Use what you know of the settlement and the factions to help guide this selection. If unsure, roll on the influence grid for a random result.
- **What is its name?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Settle-Name|Settlement Name]]_ table (page 175).

Optionally, add more details. This is appropriate if you envision your character starting at this location, or are using the settlement as a home port. If not, wait until you visit to reveal more.

- **What is the ambiance and architecture?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Settle-Appearance#Oracle Settlement Aesthetics|Settlement]]_ table (page 165).
- **What is seen at first glance?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Settle-Appearance#Oracle Settlement First Look|Settlement First Look]]_ table (page 166).
- **What else do I know of this place?** Roll on the _[[SI_CH3_Settle-Focus and Details#Oracle Settlement Details|Settlement Details]]_ table (page 170) to reveal additional aspects or rumors.

Add the settlement name to your chart, and record the details in your notes.
