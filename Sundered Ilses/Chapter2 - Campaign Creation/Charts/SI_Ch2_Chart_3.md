In this step, you generate the broad characteristics of some islands to give your character places to explore when they must be away from the sea. These islands might also be home to settlements; you generate one of those in the next step.

First, determine the number of islands using the guide shown here. This isn’t necessarily the total number of
islands in this area; it’s just a set of locations to give you a footing as your adventures get underway. Then, answer the following questions for each of the islands.

| **Region** | **Islands** |
| --- | --- |
| Myriads | 4 Islands |
| Margins | 3 Islands |
| Reaches | 2 Islands |

- **What is the island’s landscape?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Island_Landscape|Island Size]]_, _[[SI_CH3_Island_Landscape|Island Terrain]]_, and _[[SI_CH3_Island_Landscape|Island Vitality]]_ tables (page 142), and take a moment to consider what those results imply about the location. Larger islands likely have varying landscapes, but these initial results are the dominant characteristics.
- **Where is the island located?** Pick a spot on your navigation chart and draw a rough shape for the island. Give it an island-like outline with squiggly coastlines, or just make it a circle or square. But keep it relatively small among the vast seas. You want enough room to add the additional known islands in the region and reveal new places in the course of your adventures. If it’s a larger island, feel free to put it at the edge of the chart and have it extend “out of frame.”
- **Are there neighboring islands?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Island_Landscape|Nearby Islands]]_ table (page 143). If the island is part of a pair or group, add the minor islands to the map near the main island. In favorable weather, the members of an island pair or group are close enough to be visible from one another, requiring a short sail to travel from one to another. Keep it simple; the central island is your focus. You won’t generate details for the neighboring isles in this exercise, and they don’t count toward the number of islands in the region. They are like moons orbiting a home world.
- **What is its name?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Island_Name|Island Name]]_ table (page 147).

Write the island names on your chart, and create a section in your notes for island info. Leave space to add more later. When you visit or explore an island, you can generate or envision additional details.
