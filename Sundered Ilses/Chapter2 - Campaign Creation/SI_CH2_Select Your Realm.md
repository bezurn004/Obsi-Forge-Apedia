# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Select Your Realm
In this first exercise, you set the stage for your adventures by choosing a realm. Will you sail a perilous sea, navigate the lofty heights of a storm-wracked sky, or cruise among the stars?

> #missingArt Allow about 5–10 minutes for this exercise.

The Seafaring Realm is the default. The setting truths, oracles, and character assets included with this supplement assume you are undertaking nautical adventures.

However, much of this is narrative texture that can be reenvisioned to better fit your preferred realm. “Sea” becomes a colloquial term to describe airborne or starborne passages. “Islands” are floating remnants of a shattered continent—or entire planets. You can focus on using the abstract, interpretative oracles instead of those that are more specific to the default setting. No matter your choice, you undertake adventures of sail and saber in a perilous age.

In short, for the most out-of-the-box _Sundered Isles_ experience, choose the Seafaring Realm. If you are willing to make a creative leap of faith or have a specific setting in mind, the _Starforged_ system is flexible enough to accommodate other adventures.

Check the following pages for details on the realms. Scan or read those entries as you like to learn more about their features and default assumptions. Once you make your choice, continue to the [[SI_CH2_Choose Your Truths|next exercise]] on page 76.

## THE SEAFARING REALM 
<font size =3>In this realm, the _Sundered Isles_ lie within vast and perilous seas.</font>

No one knows the true extent of the isles. Untold numbers of them are scattered like broken shards across these equatorial waters.

The isles are home to a diverse array of people, societies, and cultures. Some trace their lineage to the mariners who first sailed these waters in ages past; they mark their history not in the passage of years, but through the ebb and flow of the tides and the communal memories of the generations who came before. Others settled here in recent years as refugees or outcasts from distant lands. And some seek only to exploit the resources and people of the isles for their own ends.

Seafarers who chart a course through the isles face unpredictable storms, fierce currents, shifting tides, shallow waters, and lurking marauders. For those who abide and understand the whims of the sea, this realm is home. Those who seek to control the sea, to gain mastery of it, find only a watery grave.

> [!summary] ### FEATURES
> - Mist-shrouded islands
> - Warm, turquoise seas
> - Rocky shoals, shallow reefs, and rugged islets
> - Coastal boats and mighty seagoing ships
> - Bustling ports and inland villages
> - Fast-moving storms
> - Stirrings of great beasts within shadowy depths
> - Ruins nestled in jungles, standing amid high rocks, and sunk beneath the sea
> - Skeletal frames of wrecked ships, cast against rock and reef

> This is the default when playing _Sundered Isles_. The oracles, new character assets, and other materials in this book are designed for this realm—but are often flexible enough to accommodate the other realms. Depending on the truths you select in the next exercise, your world can mirror our real-world age of sail, or spotlight more fantastical elements such as supernatural beings, steampunk-style technologies, and monstrous beasts. Your campaign might feature swashbuckling adventure, grim horror, desperate struggles against oppressive empires—or all the above! Ready to set sail with the wind in your hair and a vow in your heart? Chart a course for the seafaring realm.

## THE SKYFARING REALM
<font size=3>In this realm, the _Sundered Isles_ are the lofty fragments of a ruined continent.</font>

In a time before memory, a massive continent broke apart in an earth-shattering cataclysm. The remnants of this land were cast into the skies, held aloft by unknowable forces.

Eons later, the floating isles beckoned with mysteries and an escape from earthbound war and strife, so explorers crafted airships and launched them into the storm-wracked skies. Over time, people and nations founded burgeoning ports among the aerial enclaves, but much remains unknown and uncharted. The islands are in near-constant motion within a vortex of wind and uncanny gravitational anomalies, making navigation difficult and unpredictable.

Island ecosystems vary by altitude. In the lower regions, rain-soaked islands are covered by impenetrable jungle. Higher, temperate forests and rocky plateaus are shrouded in cold mist. Still higher, some say, icebound islands are locked in an endless winter.

> [!progress] ### FEATURES
> - Airborne islands capped by clinging vegetation
> - Waterfalls fall from broad cliffsides
> - Constant winds and passing rains
> - Flocks of birds swirl through misty skies
> - Storm clouds unleash lighting strikes and blasts of thunder
> - Villages and ports nestled among rocky enclaves
> - Ships tethered to portside docks
> - Colliding islands scatter smaller fragments

> When exploring the skyfaring realm, you interpret oracles and outcomes to fit the setting. For example, when generating a location using the Island Oracles, envision the results as the floating shard of a lost continent. In exchange for this leap of faith, this realm offers interesting possibilities for storytelling. What do settlements look like? What resources do the people trade? How are naval battles undertaken in three dimensions? Ready to soar through the skies and battle marauders in the dark heart of a thundercloud? Launch your ship into the skyfaring realm.

## THE STARFARING REALM
<font size=3>In this realm, the Sundered Isles are untold worlds adrift on aetherial tides.</font>

The people of your homeworld once navigated the oceans, but now they sail a limitless new frontier. Mighty ships harness aetherial currents and leave shimmering waves of prismatic energy in their wake. An untold number of worlds—colloquially called Isles by your once-seafaring people—spin in their complex orbits within this starry expanse.

For bold sailors who set off into this realm, the aether is life. Its starborne currents bear ships and provide breathable air in an otherwise deadly void. But the aether is capricious and ever-changing; navigating its chaotic passages demands skill, courage, and luck in equal measure.

> [!cite] ### FEATURES
> - Life-giving starborne currents
> - Colorful clouds of cosmic dust
> - Countless planets and planetoids orbiting shimmering stars
> - Aether ships gathering at bustling space ports
> - Unpredictable aether storms, vibrant with tumultuous energies
> - Strange creatures cruising in the wake of starborne vessels
> - Hulks of derelict ships, forever adrift
> - Mysterious vaults of alien civilizations

> The starfaring realm provides the greatest opportunity to freely mix-and-match your _Starforged_ and _Sundered Isles_ assets and oracles. Within this realm, you set a course for distant planets, navigate perilous asteroids fields, encounter extraordinary alien creatures—perhaps even delve ancient precursor vaults. As appropriate to the truths you select in the next exercise, your version of the setting might use technological _Starforged_ assets re-themed as aether-powered technologies.
> 
> Ready to wade into battle in your ironclad exosuit armed with a blade of scintillating energy? The starfaring realm awaits.
