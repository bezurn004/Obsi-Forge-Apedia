# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Set the Scene
In this final exercise, you decide where your story begins and identify a trouble worthy of an iron vow. You can make this exercise part of your first proper session of play, or use it to lay the keel for future play.

> Allow about 5–10 minutes for this exercise.
> 
## THE STATUS QUO
What is the situation for your character at the start of your campaign? Are you aboard a ship? Traveling overland? Arriving at a settlement? Meeting with a local connection? Using the map you created in the last exercise, consider where you find yourself or where you are bound. If you are playing with others, talk this over as a group.

As described [[SF_CH2_First Vow#Set the Scene|on page 131]] of the Starforged rulebook, you can start play with a prologue—a bit of character building and downtime before the adventure properly begins. Or you can start with a bang in medias res. The simple matter of “Where am I, and what am I doing?” can help inform the situations you face in your first session.

## THE INCITING INCIDENT
Near the start of your story, you [[SI_CH4_Swear an Iron Vow#Swear an Iron Vow Move Card|Swear an Iron Vow (SI Moves)]] to follow a goal, face a problem, or undertake a mission. This inciting incident interrupts the status quo and propels you into action. Make it a dangerous or troublesome quest.

If you already have a quest in mind to kick-off your story, you’re all set. If not, consider the narrative fodder from the previous exercises.

### TRUTHS
- **Selected truths:** Which situations, conflicts, or dangers offer an opportunity for adventure?
- **Quest starters:** Are any of the adventure seeds worth pursuing?

### FACTIONS
- **Allied factions:** Do you undertake a mission for an allied faction?
- **Enemy factions:** Will you attack or undermine an enemy faction?

### CHARACTER
- **Paths:** Do you have any duties, skills, or goals that might motivate a quest?
- **Backstory:** Does your backstory imply a danger or goal?
- **Team:** If playing co-op, do you and your allies have a shared goal?

### COMMAND
- **Ship:** Is there some aspect of your ship’s nature or history that must be dealt with? If you don’t have a command, do you undertake a quest to gain a ship of your own?
- **Crew:** Is the ship’s crew facing an urgent need, hardship, or curse?

### LOCAL AREA
- **Settlement:** Are there any settlement aspects or projects that create an opportunity for a quest?
- **Connection:** Based on their role or goal, does your connection need something from you?
- **Locations:** Is there a location that requires investigation or some pressing trouble?

*108 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## NEED INSPIRATION?
Check [[SF_CH2_Inciiting Incident|page 129]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook] for details on creating a worthy inciting incident.

If you’re still unsure how to get things started, roll on a table or two and see what drives your character at the start of the story. Here’s some suggestions:

- A task from a patron or connection: [[SI_CH3_Core_Action Theme|Action + Theme]] (pages 116–117)
- An incident at sea: _[[SI_CH3_Seafaring Fortunes#Oracle Seafaring Peril|Seafaring Peril]]_ (page 128)
- A personal mission: _[[SI_CH3_Character_Drive#Oracle Character Goals|Character Goals]]_ (page 193)
- A mysterious treasure map: _[[SI_CH3_Treasure Creation#Oracle Treasure Location|Treasure Location]]_ (page 220)

If all else fails, make something happen! Marauders attack. The sails of a tempting prize appear on the horizon. A dying mariner hands you a bloodstained map. Imperial soldiers arrive in force. A fancy gala is interrupted by a murder (or a murder is interrupted by a fancy gala). Envision what your character is doing and what event might put them on storm-tossed seas—literally or figuratively.

Forcing your character into action ripples outwards to create new opportunities and complications.

## THROW OFF THE BOWLINES
That’s it! You’ve decided the truths of the isles, forged powerful factions, created a character, launched a ship and crew, mapped the local waters, and envisioned the situation at the start of your story.

If you are new to the _Starforged_ system and want more details on swearing and undertaking your initial vow, see [[SF_CH2_First Vow#Make the Move|pages 132-134]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook. Otherwise, it’s time to set sail.

Keep in mind: these exercises were a foundation, not a mandate. If you decide to change an established aspect of the campaign—or events in your story reveal their own truth—that’s okay! Keep what you like. Change or discard what you don’t. Play to see what happens.

Fair weather and following seas, Ironsworn!
