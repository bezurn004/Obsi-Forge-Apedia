## Face Danger: Move Card
**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat,** envision your action and roll. If you act…

- With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
- With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
- With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
- With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without a cost. Make a suffer move (-1).

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
