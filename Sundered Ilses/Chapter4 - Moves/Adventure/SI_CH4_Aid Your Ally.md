# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Adventure Moves|Adventure]]: Aid Your Ally
## Aid Your Ally: Move Card
**When you act in direct support of an ally,** envision how you aid them. Then, [[SI_CH4_Secure an Advantage#Secure an Advantage Move Card|Secure an Advantage]] or [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card|Gain Ground]] to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card|Gain Ground]] and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a weak hit, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.
