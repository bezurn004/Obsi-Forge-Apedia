_Sundered Isles_ moves [anchor] use minor wording changes to better fit the setting assumptions, but mostly function identically to their _Starforged_ [8-point-star] counterparts. For details on making moves, see [[_Moves Index|Chapter 3 (page 136)]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook, or check the summary for a specific move using the _Starforged_ rulebook page references in the table above.

*236 MOVES REFERENCE*

> [!summary] # SESSION MOVES ^Session-Moves

## BEGIN A SESSION
**When you begin a significant session or chapter of play,** do all of the following.
- Identify or adjust flagged content and [[#SET A FLAG]].
- Review or recap what happened last session.
- Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

| Roll | Result |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 - 10 | Flashback reveals an aspect of your background or nature |
| 11 - 20 | Flashback reveals an aspect of another character, place, or faction |
| 21 - 30 | Influential character or faction is introduced or given new detail |
| 31 - 40 | Seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected |
| 41 - 50 | External factors create new danger, urgency, or importance for a quest |
| 51 - 60 | Important character is put in danger or suffers a misadventure |
| 61 - 70 | Key location is made unsafe or becomes mired in conflict |
| 71 - 80 | Unexpected return of an enemy or threat |
| 81 - 90 | Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view |
| 91 - 100 | Unforeseen aid is on the way or within reach |
___
## SET A FLAG
**When you identify situations or topics you don’t want to include, don’t want to envision in detail, or otherwise may need mindfulness when approaching, that content is now flagged.**

When you encounter content flagged as something to approach mindfully, pause to consider or discuss its role in your story. When you come across flagged content that you would rather adjust or omit, [[#CHANGE YOUR FATE]].
___
## CHANGE YOUR FATE
**When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the game for your comfort or enjoyment,** pause and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.
- **Reframe:** This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
- **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
- **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
- **Redirect:** Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
- **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.
___
## TAKE A BREAK

**When you resolve a progress move or complete an intense scenario,** take a few deep breaths and take some time to attend to the needs of your body. Reflect on what just happened and how it made you feel. Then, choose one.

- Move on: Continue the session. You or an ally may add +1 on the next move (not a progress move), bolstered by your reflection and past experiences.
- Stop for now: [[#END A SESSION]].
___
## END A SESSION
**When you end a significant session or chapter of play,** reflect on the events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark progress.

- If you strengthened your ties to a connection, [[#DEVELOP YOUR RELATIONSHIP]].
- If you moved forward on a quest, [[#REACH A MILESTONE]].

If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to give focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.
#
*237 SESSION MOVES*
> [!note] # ADVENTURE MOVES
> The adventure moves encompass broadly useful actions to overcome obstacles, reinforce your position, conduct investigations, influence others, and support your fellow protagonists. When you face a peril or try to gain leverage, and another move does not apply, you’ll likely find your answer among these moves. ^Adventure-Moves

## FACE DANGER
**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat,** envision your action and roll. If you act…

- With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
- With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
- With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
- With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without a cost. Make a suffer move (-1).

On a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
___
## SECURE AN ADVANTAGE
When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage, envision your action and roll. If you act…

- With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
- With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
- With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
- With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **hit**, you succeed. On a **strong hit**, take both.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.
- Take +2 momentum
- Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)
- 
On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
___
## GATHER INFORMATION
**When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze evidence, or do research,** roll +wits.

On a **strong hit,** you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1 momentum.

On a **miss,** your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
___
## COMPEL
**When you try to persuade someone or make them an offer,** envision your approach. If you…

- Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart
- Threaten or incite: Roll +iron
- Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow

On a **strong hit**, they’ll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer.

On a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand that costs you greatly. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
___
*238 MOVES REFERENCE*
## AID YOUR ALLY
**When you act in direct support of an ally,** envision how you aid them. Then, [[#SECURE AND ADVANTAGE]] or [[#GAIN GROUND]] to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you [[#GAIN GROUND]] and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a weak hit, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.
___
## CHECK YOUR GEAR
**When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource,** roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you have it, but must choose one.
- Your supply is diminished: [[#SACRIFICE RESOURCES]] (-1)
- It’s not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: [[#LOSE MOMENTUM]] (-2)

On a **miss**, you don’t have it and the situation grows more perilous. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
#
*239 ADVENTURE MOVES*
> [!progress] # QUEST MOVES ^Quest-Moves

## SWEAR AN IRON VOW
**When you swear to complete a quest,** write your vow and give it a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a connection, add +1; if you share a bond, add +2. 

On a **strong hit**, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do next. Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you are determined but begin your quest with more questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to find a path forward.

On a **miss**, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way.
___
## REACH A MILESTONE
When you make headway in your quest by doing any of the following…
- overcoming a critical obstacle
- gaining meaningful insight
- completing a perilous expedition
- acquiring a crucial item or resource
- earning vital support
- defeating a notable foe

…you may mark progress per the rank of the vow
___
## FULFILL YOUR VOW
_Porgoress Move_

When you reach the end of your quest, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit,** your vow is fulfilled. Mark a reward on your quests legacy track per the vow’s rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this vow also mark the reward.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. If you [[#SWEAR AN IRON VOW]] to set things right, take your full legacy reward. Otherwise, make the legacy reward one rank lower (none for a troublesome quest).

On a **miss,** your vow is undone through an unexpected complication or realization. Envision what happens and choose one.
- Give up on the quest: [[#FORSAKE YOUR VOW]].
- Recommit to the quest: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the vow’s rank by one (if not already epic)
___
## FORSAKE YOUR VOW
When you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is lost to you, clear the vow.

Then, envision the impact of this failure and choose one or more as appropriate to the nature of the vow. Any allies who shared this vow may also envision a cost.
- You are demoralized or dispirited: [[#ENDURE STRESS]].
- A connection loses faith: [[#TEST YOUR RELATIONSHIP]] when you next interact.
- You must abandon a path or resource: Discard an asset.
- Someone else pays a price: Envision how a person, being, or community bears the cost of the failure.
- Someone else takes advantage: Envision how an enemy gains power.
- Your reputation suffers: Envision how this failure marks you.
#
*240 MOVES REFERENCE*
> [!cite]  # CONNECTION MOVES ^Connection-Moves

## MAKE A CONNECTION
**When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion),** roll +heart.

On a **strong hit,** you create a connection. Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.

On a **miss,** you don’t make a connection and the situation worsens. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
___
## DEVELOP YOUR RELATIONSHIP
**When you reinforce your relationship with a connection** by doing any of the following…
- swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
- completing a quest to their benefit
- leveraging their help in desperate circumstances
- giving them something of worth
- sharing a profound moment
- standing with them against hardship
- overcoming a test of your relationship

…you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.

If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark progress. Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your legacy: troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4; epic=+5. 

On a **strong hit,** mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track. On a **strong hit with a match,** you may also envision how recent events bolstered your connection’s standing and raise their rank by one (if not already epic).

On a **weak hit,** take +2 momentum.

On a **miss,** take no lasting benefit.
___
## TEST YOUR RELATIONSHIP
**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance,** roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit,** [[#DEVELOP YOUR RELATIONSHIP]].

On a **weak hit,** [[#DEVELOP YOUR RELATIONSHIP]], but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a **miss,** or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.
- Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
- Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and [[#SWEAR AN IRON VOW]] (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail, the connection is permanently undone
___
## FORGE A BOND
_Progress Move_

**When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve,** roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit,** you now share a bond. Mark a reward on your bonds legacy track per the connection’s rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who share this connection also mark the reward. Then, choose one.
- Bolster their influence: When they aid you on a move closely associated with their role, add +2 instead of +1.
- Expand their influence: Give them a second role. When they aid you on a move closely associated with either role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but they ask something more of you first. To gain the bond and the legacy reward, envision the nature of the request, and do it (or [[#SWEAR AN IRON VOW]] to see it done).

On a **miss,** they reveal a motivation or background that puts you at odds. If you recommit to this relationship, roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the connection’s rank by one (if not already epic).
#
*241 CONNECTION MOVES*
> [!summary] # EXPLORATION MOVES ^Exploration-Moves

## UNDERTAKE AN EXPEDITION
**When you sail an unfamiliar route through perilous seas, find the way across hazardous terrain, or explore a mysterious site,** give the expedition a name and rank.

Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If you…
- Move at speed: Roll +edge
- Keep a low profile: Roll +shadow
- Stay vigilant: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark progress per the rank of the expedition.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.
- Suffer costs en route: Make a suffer move (-2), or two suffer moves (-1).
- Face a peril at the waypoint: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss,** you are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to confront an immediate hardship or threat. Do not mark progress, and [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
___
## EXPLORE A WAYPOINT
**When you divert from an expedition to examine a notable location,** roll +wits.

On a **strong hit,** choose one. On a **strong hit with a match,** you may instead [[#MAKE A DISCOVERY]].
- Find an opportunity: Envision a favorable insight, situation, resource, or encounter. Then, take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** you uncover something interesting, but it is bound up in a peril or reveals an ominous aspect of this place. Envision what you encounter. Then, take +1 momentum.

___
## FINISH AN EXPEDITION
_Progress Move_

**When your expedition comes to an end,** roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit,** you reach your destination or complete your survey. Mark a reward on your discoveries legacy track per expedition’s
rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this expedition also
mark the reward.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you face an unforeseen complication at the end of your expedition. Make the legacy reward one rank lower
(none for a troublesome expedition), and envision what you encounter.

On a **miss,** your destination is lost to you, or you come to understand the true nature or cost of the expedition. Envision what happens and choose one.
- Abandon the expedition: Envision the cost of this setback and [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
- Return to the expedition: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the expedition’s rank by one (if not already epic).
___
## SET A COURSE
**When you travel a known route through perilous seas, across hazardous terrain, or within a mysterious site,** roll +supply.

On a **strong hit,** you reach your destination and the situation there favors you. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** you arrive, but face a cost or complication. Choose one.
- Suffer costs en route: Make a suffer move (-2), or two suffer moves (-1).
- Face a complication at the destination: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss,** you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must Pay the Price. If you overcome this obstacle, you may push on safely to your
destination.
#
*242 MOVE REFERENCE*
## MAKE A DISCOVERY

*243 EXPLORATION MOVES*
> [!tldr] # COMBAT MOVES
> In a fight, your character is in one of two positions: in control or in a bad spot. If you are in control, you can make proactive moves such as [[#GAIN GROUND]] and [[#STRIKE]]. When in a bad spot, you must make reactive moves such as [[#REACT UNDER FIRE]] and [[#CLASH]]. The outcome of a combat move will describe your current position.
> 
> When you make a move that doesn’t define your position (such as a suffer move), follow these guidelines:

*244 MOVES REFERENCE*
## TAKE DECISIVE ACTION
_Progress Move_

**When you seize an objective in a fight,** envision how you take decisive action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak hit as a miss.

On a **strong hit,** you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives remain and the fight continues, you are in control.

On a **weak hit,** you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.

| Roll | Result |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 - 40 | It’s worse than you thought: Make a suffer move (-2) |
| 41 - 52 | Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe appears |
| 53 - 64 | You face collateral damage: Something is lost, damaged, or broken |
| 65 - 76 | Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost |
| 77 - 88 | Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance |
| 89 - 100 | It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective is revealed

On a **miss,** you are defeated or your objective is lost. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
___
## FACE DEFEAT
**When you abandon or are deprived of an objective,** envision the consequence of this failure, clear the objective, and [[#PAY THE PRICE]].

If the fight continues, you may create a new objective and give it a rank to represent the changing situation. If any objectives remain, the fight continues and you are in a bad spot
___
## BATTLE
**When you fight a battle and it happens in a blur,** envision your objective and roll. If you primarily…

> 
> **Momentum Reset**
> If you have one marked impact, your momentum reset is +1 (instead of +2). If you have more than one marked impact, your momentum reset is 0 (instead of +2).

## LOSE MOMENTUM
**When you are delayed or disadvantaged,** suffer -1 momentum for a minor setback, -2 for a serious setback, or -3 for a major setback.

When your momentum is at its minimum (-6) and you must suffer -momentum, choose one.
- Envision how the price is paid and apply the cost to a different suffer move.
- Envision how this undermines your progress on a vow, expedition, connection, or combat. Then, clear 1 unit of progress on that track per its rank: troublesome=3 boxes; dangerous=2 boxes; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 ticks; epic=1 tick.

On a **strong hit,** choose one.
- Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health
- Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit,** if you are not wounded, you may [[#LOSE MOMENTUM]] (-1) in exchange for +1 health. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss,** it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 health or [[#LOSE MOMENTUM]] (-2). If your health is 0, you must also mark wounded or permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.

*247 SUFFER MOVES*
> [!success] # RECOVER MOVES
> When you Repair and score a hit, you gain repair points. This is a limited resource used only within the scope of the move to prioritize and make repairs. The amount of repair points you earn varies according to the situation and the outcome of the move, per the included table. Here’s a summary of those situations. ^Recover-Moves
> 
> **At a Facility** 
> Serviced by a dockyard or other facility—not making your own repairs.
> 
> **At Anchor**> 
> Making your own repairs while docked, anchored, or encamped—with sufficient time to give the repairs proper attention.
> 
> **Underway**
> Making your own repairs while traveling or under time pressure.
> 
> **Under Fire**
> Making your own repairs in a crisis, such as during combat, while navigating a hazardous environment, under extreme time pressure, or dealing with life-and-death repair issues.

##  SOJOURN
**When you spend time recovering within a community,** roll +heart.

On a **strong hit,** this is a safe refuge. You and your allies may each choose two recover moves: [[#HEAL]], [[#HEARTEN]], [[#REPAIR]], or [[#RESUPPLY]]. Instead of rolling, assume an automatic strong hit for each. An individual move can be taken more than once.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but time is short or resources are strained. You and your allies each make one recover move instead of two, with no more than three moves total among the group.

On a **miss,** choose one.
- The community needs your help, or makes a costly demand in exchange for safe harbor. Envision what they ask of you. If you do it, or [[#SWEAR AN IRON VOW]] to see it done, resolve this move as a strong hit.
- You find no relief, and the situation grows worse. [[#Pay the Price]].
___
## HEAL
**When you receive medical care or provide treatment,** envision the situation and roll. If you…
- Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
- Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
- Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
- Provide care: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: [[#LOSE MOMENTUM]] (-2) or [[#SACRIFICE RESOURCES]] (-2).

On a **miss,** the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. [[#Pay the Price]].
___
## HEARTEN
**When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace,** roll +heart.

On a **strong hit,** you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you Sojourn, take +1 more.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, [[#LOSE MOMENTUM]] (-1).

On a **miss,** you take no comfort and the situation worsens. [[#PAY THE PRICE]]
___
## RESUPPLY
**When you attempt to bolster your readiness,** envision the opportunity and your approach.
If you…
- Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
- Threaten or seize: Roll +iron
- Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
- Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits
- Gear up from your ship’s stores: Roll +supply (hold)

On a **strong hit,** choose one.
- If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take +1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.
- If you are in need of a specific item, resource, or service that can reasonably be obtained, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle.

On a **miss,** you gain nothing and the situation worsens. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
#
*248 MOVES REFERENCE*
## REPAIR
**When you make or obtain repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other equipment,** envision the situation and roll. If you…
- Make your own repairs, or direct companions or crewmembers to make repairs: Roll +wits
- Obtain repair services at a facility: Roll +heart

On **a hit,** you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the table below. Additionally, if you make your own repairs, you may [[#SACRIFICE RESOURCES]] (hold) and exchange each -1 of supply for 1 extra repair point (up to 3 points).

| Situation | Strong Hit | Weak Hit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At a facility | 7 points | 5 points |
| At anchor | 4 points | 2 points |
| Underway | 3 points | 1 points |
| Under fire | 2 points | 0 points |

Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.
- Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points
- Fix one broken module: 2 points
- Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point
- Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point

**When you encounter a situation where death is an immediate and unavoidable outcome,** you are dead. **When you are instead brought to the brink of death with a chance for recovery or redemption,** roll +heart.

On a **strong hit,** you are cast back into the mortal world.

On a **weak hit,** choose one. 
- You die, but not before making a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
- There is more to be done. Envision what is revealed or asked of you at death’s door, and [[#SWEAR AN IRON VOW]] to complete an extreme quest. You return to the mortal world and must mark doomed. When you complete the death-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **strong hit,** you resist and press on.

On a **weak hit,** choose one.
- Your spirit breaks, but not before you make a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
- You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision that dark future, and [[#SWEAR AN IRON VOW]] to prevent it through an extreme quest. You return to your senses and must mark tormented. When you complete the soul-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss,** you succumb to despair or horror and are lost.
___
## OVERCOME DESTRUCTION
_Progress Move_

**When your command vehicle is destroyed or irrevocably lost,** you must discard the asset, along with any modules and docked support vehicles.

If you survive, you may use your connections to replace some of what was lost. To learn the cost, roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress on your bonds legacy track.

On a **strong hit,** you may call in a favor. This comes without conditions.

On a **weak hit,** you owe someone. You must mark indebted and [[#SWEAR AN IRON VOW]] to complete an extreme quest in their service. When you complete the duty-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss,** as with the weak hit result, but this quest is against your nature, forces you to [[#FORSAKE YOUR VOW]] on another quest, or is in the service of an enemy.

If you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every marked ability on the discarded assets (minimum 3 experience). Spend this experience only on a new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles.

Once you completely fill the tenth box on any legacy track, clear that track. You may start again marking progress on the cleared track, but earn experience at a reduced rate of 1 experience (instead of 2) for each filled progress box. If you make a progress roll against this track, resolve the outcome as if at 10 progress
___
## ADVANCE

- Support Vehicle: Acquire or improve a secondary vehicle
- Path: Bolster your personal capabilities or follow a new calling
- Companion: Gain or improve a trusted helper
- Deed: Learn from your experiences or build a legacy
___
## CONTINUE A LEGACY
_Progress Move_

**When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, or succumb to death or desolation,** you may create a new character in your established setting. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare to each of the former character’s legacy tracks: quests, bonds, and discoveries (one roll per track).

For each **strong hit,** choose one from below, or one from the weak hit or miss options.
- Follow their path: Take one path or companion asset from the former character (at no cost), including any marked abilities.
- Share a connection: Take one connection from the former character, including any accrued progress or bond benefits.
- Accept an inheritance: Take the former character’s command vehicle and one module or support vehicle (at no cost), including any marked abilities.

For each **weak hit,** choose one from below, or one from the miss options.

> [!note] # SCENE CHALLENGES
> A ==scene challenge== is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non- combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency. Scene challenges use a troublesome, dangerous, or formidable progress track countered by a tension clock with four segments.
> 
> Make the [[#BEGIN A SCENE]] move to start the challenge. To act within the scene, use the alternative versions of [[#FACE DANGER (SCENE CHALLENGE)|FACE DANGER]] and [[#SECURE AN ADVANTAGE (SCENE CHALLENGE)|SECURE AN ADVANTAGE]] shown here. When the clock or progress track is filled, or the narrative guides you to a conclusion, [[#FINISH A SCENE]]. ^Scene-Challenges

## BEGIN A SCENE
**When you face an extended or complex challenge,** name your objective and choose a rank as appropriate to the situation.
- You have a clear advantage: Troublesome
- You are ready to act: Dangerous
- You are unprepared or outmatched: Formidable
Then, activate a 4-segment tension clock and [[#FACE DANGER (SCENE CHALLENGE)|FACE DANGER]] or [[#SECURE AN ADVANTAGE (SCENE CHALLENGE)|SECURE AN ADVANTAGE]] to take action.
___
## FACE DANGER (SCENE CHALLENGE)
**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat within a scene challenge,** envision your action and roll. If you act…
- With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
- With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
- With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
- With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** you are successful and mark progress. On a strong hit with a match, mark progress twice.

On a **weak hit,** you are successful and mark progress, but also encounter a complication or setback. Envision what occurs and fill a clock segment.

On a **miss,** you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dramatic turn of events. Fill a clock segment and [[#PAY THE PRICE]]. On a **miss with a match,** fill two segments and [[#PAY THE PRICE]].

- With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
- With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
- With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **hit,** you are successful. On a strong hit, take both. On a **strong hit with a match,** take both and mark progress.

On a **weak hit,** choose one.
- Take +2 momentum
- Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss,** you fail or your assumptions betray you. Fill a clock segment and [[#PAY THE PRICE]]. On a **miss with a match,** fill two segments and [[#PAY THE PRICE]].

## FINISH A SCENE
_Progress Move_

**When the scene challenge tension clock or progress track is filled, or when events lead to the scene’s conclusion,** roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit,** you achieve your objective unconditionally.

On a **weak hit,** you succeed, but not without cost. You must [[#PAY THE PRICE]]. Make this a minor cost relative to the scope of the scene.

On a **miss,** you fail or are undermined by a dire turn of events. [[#PAY THE PRICE]].
#
*254 MOVES REFERENCE*
## QUICK REFERENCE
**"ADD +X”**
Add this value to your action die. For most action rolls, your action die + stat + adds is your final action score. If you gain multiple prompts to “add +x” for a single action, those bonuses stack.

**“MARK PROGRESS”**
When a move or asset ability prompts you to mark progress, check the rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks in your progress track. If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

**“MARK PROGRESS TWICE”**
If a move or asset ability prompts you to “mark progress twice,” mark double the number of ticks or boxes per the rank of the challenge. For example, marking progress twice on a troublesome challenge would mean marking 6 boxes (instead of 3). Any additional instances of “mark progress” in the same action stack on top of this reward.

**“ONCE PER SITUATION”**
A “situation” includes the entirety of an encounter, fight, or attempt to overcome an obstacle. When an asset ability is limited to “once per situation,” it cannot be used again without a meaningful change in your circumstance and intention. For a more complete glossary of terms, see [page 388] of the _Starforged_ rulebook.

**“PROGRESS MOVE”**
This is a special move to resolve a goal or challenge. When you make a progress move, tally the number of filled boxes on your progress track as your progress score. Only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal. You may not burn momentum on a progress move and are not affected by negative momentum. In addition, asset abilities do not affect progress rolls unless they define a specific benefit for a progress move.

**“ROLL +[STAT/METER/OTHER]”**
This is the basic action roll. Most action rolls are made by adding the value of a stat to your action die. Moves may indicate a stat you should use, such as “roll +iron.” If it doesn’t, or gives you a choice, use the stat that best fits the situation and your approach. Some moves and asset abilities will prompt you to use a condition meter or other value instead of a stat.

**“TAKE +X”**
Add this number to the indicated meter. For example, “take +2 momentum” tells you to add 2 to your momentum meter. Unless stated otherwise, asset bonuses are in addition to the benefits you gain as part of a move. If you take +2 momentum as a move outcome, and you are aided by an asset that tells you to “take +1 momentum,” you gain a total of +3 momentum. 

**"WHEN YOU…”**
This is the move trigger. When you do this thing, or encounter this situation, make the move.
