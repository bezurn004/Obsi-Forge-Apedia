## Ask the Oracle: Move Card
**When you seek to resolve questions, reveal details, discover locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events,** you may…
- Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.
- Spark an idea: Use an oracle table or other random prompt.
- Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the table below to check the answer.
- Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as likely, and roll on the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.

| Odds | The answer is yes if you roll… |
| :---: | --- |
| Small | Chance 10 or less |
| Unlikely | 25 or less |
| 50/50 | 50 or less |
| Likely | 75 or less |
| Almost | Certain 90 or less |

On a match, envision an extreme result or twist.
