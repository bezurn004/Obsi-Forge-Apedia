# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]]: Fate
In solo or co-op play, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle]] when you have a question about the outcome of an action, an aspect of your setting, or a narrative event.
___
A match on your oracle dice when rolling on the yes/no table indicates an extreme result, interesting twist, or dramatic complication.
___
In guided play, the guide is the oracle. When the players pose a question or a situation creates uncertainty, the guide can decide an answer, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle]] for inspiration, or turn the question back to the players
___
Make the [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price (SI Moves)]] move when prompted by another move due to a negative outcome, or when the current situation naturally leads to a cost through your choices or actions.
___
To determine the cost when you [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]], you may decide the outcome yourself, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle]] for insight, or roll on the included table. In guided play, look to the guide for a ruling.

The price you pay can be a narrative consequence that complicates things for your character, or a combination of a narrative and mechanical cost. But be mindful of pacing; don’t drop the hammer after one bad roll. Start with lesser complications and consequences appropriate to the situation, then apply escalating danger and hardships if the failures stack up.
