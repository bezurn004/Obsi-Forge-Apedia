# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]]: Suffer
When you bear the brunt of a failed action or make a concession, the suffer moves help resolve the cost. These moves are typically made when you must [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]] and face a hardship that directly impacts your well-being and readiness, or as prompted by a move or asset.

If you mark an impact as an outcome of a suffer move, reduce your max momentum and momentum reset.

**Max Momentum**
Your max momentum is reduced by 1 for each marked impact. For example, one impact will drop your max momentum to +9. Three impacts will reduce it to +7.

**Momentum Reset**
If you have one marked impact, your momentum reset is +1 (instead of +2). If you have more than one marked impact, your momentum reset is 0 (instead of +2).
