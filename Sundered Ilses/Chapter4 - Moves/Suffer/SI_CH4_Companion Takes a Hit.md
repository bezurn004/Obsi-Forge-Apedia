## Companion Takes a Hit: Move Card
**When your companion faces physical hardship,** they suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your companion’s health is 0, [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if their health is 0 or you choose to test their resilience, roll +your companion’s health.

On a **strong hit,** your companion rallies. Give them +1 health.

On a **weak hit,** if your companion’s health is not 0, you may [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] (-1) and give them +1 health. Otherwise, they press on.

On a **miss,** it’s worse than you thought. They suffer an additional -1 health or you [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] (-2). If your companion’s health is 0, they are out of action until given aid. If their health is 0 and you rolled a miss with a match on this move, they are dead or destroyed; discard the asset
