# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Suffer Moves|Suffer]]: Endure Stress
## Endure Stress: Move Card
**When you face mental strain, shock, or despair,** suffer -1 spirit for minor stress, -2 for serious stress, or -3 for major stress. If your spirit is 0, [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] equal to any remaining stress 

Then, if your spirit is 0 or you choose to resist the stress, roll +spirit or +heart, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit,** choose one.
- Shake it off: If you are not shaken, take +1 spirit
- Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit,** if you are not shaken, you may [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] (-1) in exchange for +1 spirit. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss,** it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 spirit or [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] (-2). If your spirit is 0, you must also mark shaken or traumatized, or roll on the table below.

| Roll | Results |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 - 10 | You are overwhelmed. Face Desolation. |
| 11 - 25 | You give up. Forsake Your Vow. |
| 26 - 50 | You give in to fear or compulsion, and act against your better instincts. |
| 51 - 100 | You persevere. |
