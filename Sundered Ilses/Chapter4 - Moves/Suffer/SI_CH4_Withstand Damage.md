# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Suffer Moves|Suffer]]: Withstand Damage
## Withstand Damage: Move Card
When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment, suffer -1 integrity for minor damage, -2 for serious damage, or -3 for major damage. If your integrity is 0, [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] equal to any remaining damage.

Then, if your integrity is 0 or you choose to resist the damage, roll +integrity.

On a **strong hit,** choose one.
- Damage control: If your vehicle is not battered, take +1 integrity
- Hold fast : Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit,** if your vehicle is not battered, you may [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] (-1) in exchange for +1 integrity. Otherwise, carry on.

On a **miss,** it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 integrity or [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] (-2). If your integrity is 0, also suffer a cost according to the vehicle type.
- Command vehicle: Mark the vehicle as battered or cursed, mark a module as broken, destroy a broken module by discarding it, or roll on the table below. If the command vehicle is destroyed or sunk, Overcome Destruction.
- Support vehicle: Mark the vehicle as battered or roll on the table below. If the vehicle is destroyed or sunk, discard the asset.
- Incidental vehicle: Roll on the table below.

| 11 - 25 | Destruction or sinking is imminent and unavoidable. All aboard must find a way to safety. |

| 56 - 70 | The vehicle is crippled. To get it back in action, you must Repair and raise its integrity above 0. |
| 71 - 85 | Those aboard bear the brunt of the damage. You and your allies must make the Endure Harm, Endure Stress, or Companion Takes a Hit move, suffering a serious (-2) cost. |
| 86 - 95 | You’ve lost gear, cargo, or provisions. [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources\|Sacrifice Resources]] (-2). |
