## Earn Experience: Move Card
When you fill a box (four ticks) on any legacy track, take 2 experience. This experience may be spent when you [ADVANCE].

Once you completely fill the tenth box on any legacy track, clear that track. You may start again marking progress on the cleared track, but earn experience at a reduced rate of 1 experience (instead of 2) for each filled progress box. If you make a progress roll against this track, resolve the outcome as if at 10 progress
