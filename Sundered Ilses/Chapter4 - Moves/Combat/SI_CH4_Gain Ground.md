## Gain Ground: Move Card
**When you are in control and take action in a fight to reinforce your position or move toward an objective,** envision your approach and roll. If you are…
- In pursuit, fleeing, or maneuvering: Roll +edge
- Charging boldly into action, coming to the aid of others, negotiating, or commanding: Roll +heart
- Gaining leverage with force, powering through, or making a threat: Roll +iron
- Hiding, preparing an ambush, or misdirecting: Roll +shadow
- Coordinating a plan, studying a situation, or cleverly gaining leverage: Roll +wits

On a **hit,** you stay in control. On a **strong hit,** choose two. On a **weak hit,** choose one.
- Mark progress
- Take +2 momentum
- Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss,** your foe gains the upper hand, the fight moves to a new location, or you encounter a new peril. You are in a bad spot and must [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
