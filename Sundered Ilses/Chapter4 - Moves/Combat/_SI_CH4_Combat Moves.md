# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]]: Combat
In a fight, your character is in one of two positions: in control or in a bad spot. If you are in control, you can make proactive moves such as [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card|Gain Ground]] and [[SI_CH4_Strike#Strike Move Card|Strike (SI Moves)]]. When in a bad spot, you must make reactive moves such as [[SI_CH4_React Under Fire#React Under Fire Move Card|React Under Fire]] and [[SI_CH4_Clash#Clash Move Card|Clash (SI Moves)]]. The outcome of a combat move will describe your current position.

When you make a move that doesn’t define your position (such as a suffer move), follow these guidelines:

On a strong hit, you are in control

On a weak hit or miss, you are in a bad spot.
