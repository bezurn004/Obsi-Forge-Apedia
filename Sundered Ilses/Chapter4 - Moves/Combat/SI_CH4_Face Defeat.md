## Face Defeat: Move Card
**When you abandon or are deprived of an objective,** envision the consequence of this failure, clear the objective, and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].

If the fight continues, you may create a new objective and give it a rank to represent the changing situation. If any objectives remain, the fight continues and you are in a bad spot
