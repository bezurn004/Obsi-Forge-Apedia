## Take Decisive Action: Move Card
_Progress Move_

**When you seize an objective in a fight,** envision how you take decisive action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak hit as a miss.

On a **strong hit,** you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives remain and the fight continues, you are in control.

On a **weak hit,** you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.

| Roll | Result |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 - 40 | It’s worse than you thought: Make a suffer move (-2) |
| 41 - 52 | Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe appears |
| 53 - 64 | You face collateral damage: Something is lost, damaged, or broken |
| 65 - 76 | Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost |
| 77 - 88 | Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance |
| 89 - 100 | It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective is revealed

On a **miss,** you are defeated or your objective is lost. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
