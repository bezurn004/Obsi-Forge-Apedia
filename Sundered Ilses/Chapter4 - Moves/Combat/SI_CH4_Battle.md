## Battle: Move Card
**When you fight a battle and it happens in a blur,** envision your objective and roll. If you primarily…
- Fight at range, or using your speed and the environment to your advantage: Roll +edge.
- Fight depending on your courage, leadership, or companions: Roll +heart.
- Fight in close to overpower your foe: Roll +iron.
- Fight using trickery to befuddle your foe: Roll +shadow.
- Fight using careful tactics to outsmart your foe: Roll +wits.

On a **strong hit,** you achieve your objective unconditionally. You and any allies who joined the battle may take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** you achieve your objective, but not without cost. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].

On a **miss,** you are defeated or the objective is lost. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
