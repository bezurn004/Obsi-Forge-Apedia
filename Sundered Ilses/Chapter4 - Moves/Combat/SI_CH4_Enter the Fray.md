# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Combat Moves|Combat]]: Enter the Fray
## Enter the Fray: Move Card
**When you initiate combat or are forced into a fight,** envision your objective and give it a rank. If the combat includes discrete challenges or phases, set an objective with a rank for each.

Then, roll to see if you are in control. If you are…
- On the move or maneuvering: Roll +edge
- In command or facing off against your foe: Roll +heart
- In the thick of it at close quarters: Roll +iron
- Preparing to act against an unaware foe: Roll +shadow
- Caught in a trap or sizing up the situation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** take both. On a **weak hit,** choose one.
- Take +2 momentum
- You are in control

On a **miss,** the fight begins with you in a bad spot.
