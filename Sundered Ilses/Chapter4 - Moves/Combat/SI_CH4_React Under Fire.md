## React Under Fire: Move Card
**When you are in a bad spot and take action in a fight to avoid danger or overcome an obstacle,** envision your approach and roll. If you are…
- In pursuit, fleeing, dodging, getting back into position, or taking cover: Roll +edge
- Remaining stalwart against fear or temptation Roll +heart
- Blocking or diverting with force, or taking the hit: Roll +iron
- Moving into hiding or creating a distraction: Roll +shadow
- Changing the plan, finding a way out, or cleverly bypassing an obstacle: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** you succeed and are in control. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** you avoid the worst of the danger or overcome the obstacle, but not without a cost. Make a suffer move (-1). You stay in a bad spot.

On a **miss,** the situation worsens. You stay in a bad spot and must [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]]
