# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]]: Quick Reference
**"ADD +X”**
Add this value to your action die. For most action rolls, your action die + stat + adds is your final action score. If you gain multiple prompts to “add +x” for a single action, those bonuses stack.

**“MARK PROGRESS”**
When a move or asset ability prompts you to mark progress, check the rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks in your progress track. If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

**“MARK PROGRESS TWICE”**
If a move or asset ability prompts you to “mark progress twice,” mark double the number of ticks or boxes per the rank of the challenge. For example, marking progress twice on a troublesome challenge would mean marking 6 boxes (instead of 3). Any additional instances of “mark progress” in the same action stack on top of this reward.

**“ONCE PER SITUATION”**
A “situation” includes the entirety of an encounter, fight, or attempt to overcome an obstacle. When an asset ability is limited to “once per situation,” it cannot be used again without a meaningful change in your circumstance and intention. For a more complete glossary of terms, see [page 388] of the _Starforged_ rulebook.

**“PROGRESS MOVE”**
This is a special move to resolve a goal or challenge. When you make a progress move, tally the number of filled boxes on your progress track as your progress score. Only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal. You may not burn momentum on a progress move and are not affected by negative momentum. In addition, asset abilities do not affect progress rolls unless they define a specific benefit for a progress move.

**“ROLL +[STAT/METER/OTHER]”**
This is the basic action roll. Most action rolls are made by adding the value of a stat to your action die. Moves may indicate a stat you should use, such as “roll +iron.” If it doesn’t, or gives you a choice, use the stat that best fits the situation and your approach. Some moves and asset abilities will prompt you to use a condition meter or other value instead of a stat.

**“TAKE +X”**
Add this number to the indicated meter. For example, “take +2 momentum” tells you to add 2 to your momentum meter. Unless stated otherwise, asset bonuses are in addition to the benefits you gain as part of a move. If you take +2 momentum as a move outcome, and you are aided by an asset that tells you to “take +1 momentum,” you gain a total of +3 momentum. 

**"WHEN YOU…”**
This is the move trigger. When you do this thing, or encounter this situation, make the move.
