# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Connection Moves|Connection]]: Develop Your Relationship
## Develop Your Relationship: Move Card
**When you reinforce your relationship with a connection** by doing any of the following…
- swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
- completing a quest to their benefit
- leveraging their help in desperate circumstances
- giving them something of worth
- sharing a profound moment
- standing with them against hardship
- overcoming a test of your relationship

…you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.

If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark progress. Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your legacy: troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4; epic=+5. 

On a **strong hit,** mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track. On a **strong hit with a match,** you may also envision how recent events bolstered your connection’s standing and raise their rank by one (if not already epic).

On a **weak hit,** take +2 momentum.

On a **miss,** take no lasting benefit.
