# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Connection Moves|Connection]]: Test Your Relationship
## Test Your Relationship: Move Card
**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance,** roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit,** [[SI_CH4_Develop Your Relationship#Develop Your Relationship Move Card|Develop Your Relationship]].

On a **weak hit,** [[SI_CH4_Develop Your Relationship#Develop Your Relationship Move Card|Develop Your Relationship]], but also envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.

On a **miss,** or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, choose one.
- Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
- Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and [[SI_CH4_Swear an Iron Vow#Swear an Iron Vow Move Card|Swear an Iron Vow]] (formidable or greater) to see it done. Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail, the connection is permanently undone
