## Make a Connection: Move Card
**When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing relationship (not an ally or companion),** roll +heart.

On a **strong hit,** you create a connection. Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.

On a **miss,** you don’t make a connection and the situation worsens. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
