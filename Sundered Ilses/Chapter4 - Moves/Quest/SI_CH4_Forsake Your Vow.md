# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Quest Moves|Quest]]: Forsake Your Vow
## Forsake Your Vow: Move Card
When you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is lost to you, clear the vow.

Then, envision the impact of this failure and choose one or more as appropriate to the nature of the vow. Any allies who shared this vow may also envision a cost.
- You are demoralized or dispirited: [[SI_CH4_Endure Stress#Endure Stress Move Card|Endure Stress]].
- A connection loses faith: [[SI_CH4_Test Your Relationship#Test Your Relationship Move Card|Test Your Relationship]] when you next interact.
- You must abandon a path or resource: Discard an asset.
- Someone else pays a price: Envision how a person, being, or community bears the cost of the failure.
- Someone else takes advantage: Envision how an enemy gains power.
- Your reputation suffers: Envision how this failure marks you.
