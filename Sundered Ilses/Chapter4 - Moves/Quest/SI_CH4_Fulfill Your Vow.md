# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Quest Moves|Quest]]: Fulfill Your Vow
## Fulfill Your Vow: Move Card
_Porgoress Move_

**When you reach the end of your quest,** roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit,** your vow is fulfilled. Mark a reward on your quests legacy track per the vow’s rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this vow also mark the reward.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. If you [[SI_CH4_Swear an Iron Vow#Swear an Iron Vow Move Card|Swear an Iron Vow]] to set things right, take your full legacy reward. Otherwise, make the legacy reward one rank lower (none for a troublesome quest).

On a **miss,** your vow is undone through an unexpected complication or realization. Envision what happens and choose one.
- Give up on the quest: [[SI_CH4_Forsake Your Vow#Forsake Your Vow Move Card|Forsake Your Vow]].
- Recommit to the quest: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the vow’s rank by one (if not already epic)
