## Resupply: Move Card
**When you attempt to bolster your readiness,** envision the opportunity and your approach.
If you…
- Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
- Threaten or seize: Roll +iron
- Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
- Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits
- Gear up from your ship’s stores: Roll +supply (hold)

On a **strong hit,** choose one.
- If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take +1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.
- If you are in need of a specific item, resource, or service that can reasonably be obtained, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle.

On a **miss,** you gain nothing and the situation worsens. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
