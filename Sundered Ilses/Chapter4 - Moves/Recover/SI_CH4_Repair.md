## Repair: Move Card
**When you make or obtain repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other equipment,** envision the situation and roll. If you…
- Make your own repairs, or direct companions or crewmembers to make repairs: Roll +wits
- Obtain repair services at a facility: Roll +heart

On **a hit,** you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the table below. Additionally, if you make your own repairs, you may [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources#Sacrifice Resources Move Card|Sacrifice Resources]] (hold) and exchange each -1 of supply for 1 extra repair point (up to 3 points).

| Situation | Strong Hit | Weak Hit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At a facility | 7 points | 5 points |
| At anchor | 4 points | 2 points |
| Underway | 3 points | 1 points |
| Under fire | 2 points | 0 points |

Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.
- Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points
- Fix one broken module: 2 points
- Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point
- Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point
- Repair any other component or device: 3 points
- Repair any other equipment or device, but with a complication or malfunction: 2 points

On a **miss,** the repairs are not made and the situation worsens. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
