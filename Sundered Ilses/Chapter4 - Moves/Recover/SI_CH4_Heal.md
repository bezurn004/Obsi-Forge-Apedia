## Heal: Move Card
**When you receive medical care or provide treatment,** envision the situation and roll. If you…
- Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
- Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
- Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
- Provide care: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum]] (-2) or [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources#Sacrifice Resources Move Card|Sacrifice Resources (SI Moves)]] (-2).

On a **miss,** the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]]
