## Change Your Fate: Move Card
**When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the game for your comfort or enjoyment,** pause and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.
- **Reframe:** This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes the content.
- **Refocus:** This is not the most important thing happening right now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
- **Replace:** This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
- **Redirect:** Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision how another person or party becomes involved.
- **Reshape:** The situation changes completely. Envision what happened instead.
