## Begin a Session: Move Card
**When you begin a significant session or chapter of play,** do all of the following.
- Identify or adjust flagged content and [[SI_CH4_Set a Flag#Set a Flag Move Card|Set a Flag]].
- Review or recap what happened last session.
- Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation and intent.

In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective. If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.
