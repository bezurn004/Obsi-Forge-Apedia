## End a Session: Move Card
**When you end a significant session or chapter of play,** reflect on the events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark progress.

- If you strengthened your ties to a connection, [[SI_CH4_Develop Your Relationship#Develop Your Relationship Move Card|Develop Your Relationship]].
- If you moved forward on a quest, [[SI_CH4_Reach a Milestone#Reach a Milestone Move Card|Reach a Milestone]].

If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to give focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.
