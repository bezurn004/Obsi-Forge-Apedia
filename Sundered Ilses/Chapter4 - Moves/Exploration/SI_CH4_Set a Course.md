## Set a Course: Move Card
**When you travel a known route through perilous seas, across hazardous terrain, or within a mysterious site,** roll +supply.

On a **strong hit,** you reach your destination and the situation there favors you. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit,** you arrive, but face a cost or complication. Choose one.
- Suffer costs en route: Make a suffer move (-2), or two suffer moves (-1).
- Face a complication at the destination: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss,** you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]]. If you overcome this obstacle, you may push on safely to your destination.
