# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Exploration Moves|Exploration]]: Undertake an Expedition
## Undertake an Expedition: Move Card
**When you sail an unfamiliar route through perilous seas, find the way across hazardous terrain, or explore a mysterious site,** give the expedition a name and rank.

Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If you…
- Move at speed: Roll +edge
- Keep a low profile: Roll +shadow
- Stay vigilant: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark progress per the rank of the expedition.

On a **weak hit,** as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.
- Suffer costs en route: Make a suffer move (-2), or two suffer moves (-1).
- Face a peril at the waypoint: Envision what you encounter.

On a **miss,** you are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to confront an immediate hardship or threat. Do not mark progress, and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
