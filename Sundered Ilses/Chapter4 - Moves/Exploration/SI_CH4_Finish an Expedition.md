# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Exploration Moves|Exploration]]: Finish an Expedition
## Finish an Expedition: Move Card
_Progress Move_

**When your expedition comes to an end,** roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

On a **strong hit,** you reach your destination or complete your survey. Mark a reward on your discoveries legacy track per expedition’s
rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this expedition also
mark the reward.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you face an unforeseen complication at the end of your expedition. Make the legacy reward one rank lower
(none for a troublesome expedition), and envision what you encounter.

On a **miss,** your destination is lost to you, or you come to understand the true nature or cost of the expedition. Envision what happens and choose one.
- Abandon the expedition: Envision the cost of this setback and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
- Return to the expedition: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the expedition’s rank by one (if not already epic).
