## Face Desolation: Move Card
**When you are brought to the brink of desolation,** roll +heart.

On a **strong hit,** you resist and press on.

On a **weak hit,** choose one.
- Your spirit breaks, but not before you make a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
- You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision that dark future, and [[SI_CH4_Swear an Iron Vow#Swear an Iron Vow Move Card|Swear an Iron Vow]] to prevent it through an extreme quest. You return to your senses and must mark tormented. When you complete the soul-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss,** you succumb to despair or horror and are lost.
