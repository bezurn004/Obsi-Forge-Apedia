# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Threshold Moves|Threshold]]: Face Death
## Face Death: Move Card
**When you encounter a situation where death is an immediate and unavoidable outcome,** you are dead. **When you are instead brought to the brink of death with a chance for recovery or redemption,** roll +heart.

On a **strong hit,** you are cast back into the mortal world.

On a **weak hit,** choose one. 
- You die, but not before making a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
- There is more to be done. Envision what is revealed or asked of you at death’s door, and [[SI_CH4_Swear an Iron Vow#Swear an Iron Vow Move Card|Swear an Iron Vow]] to complete an extreme quest. You return to the mortal world and must mark doomed. When you complete the death-bound quest, clear the impact.
- 
On a **miss,** you are dead.
