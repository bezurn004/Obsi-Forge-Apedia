## Overcome Destruction: Move Card
_Progress Move_

**When your command vehicle is destroyed or irrevocably lost,** you must discard the asset, along with any modules and docked support vehicles.

If you survive, you may use your connections to replace some of what was lost. To learn the cost, roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress on your bonds legacy track.

On a **strong hit,** you may call in a favor. This comes without conditions.

On a **weak hit,** you owe someone. You must mark indebted and [[SI_CH4_Swear an Iron Vow#Swear an Iron Vow Move Card|Swear an Iron Vow]] to complete an extreme quest in their service. When you complete the duty-bound quest, clear the impact.

On a **miss,** as with the weak hit result, but this quest is against your nature, forces you to [[SI_CH4_Forsake Your Vow#Forsake Your Vow Move Card|Forsake Your Vow]] on another quest, or is in the service of an enemy.

If you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every marked ability on the discarded assets (minimum 3 experience). Spend this experience only on a new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles.
