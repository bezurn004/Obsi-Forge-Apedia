- With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
- With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit,** you are successful and mark progress. On a strong hit with a match, mark progress twice.

On a **weak hit,** you are successful and mark progress, but also encounter a complication or setback. Envision what occurs and fill a clock segment.

On a **miss,** you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dramatic turn of events. Fill a clock segment and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]]. On a **miss with a match,** fill two segments and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
