# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch4_Contents|Moves]] - [[_SI_CH4_Scene Challenges|Scene Challenge]]: Secure an Advantage
## Secure an Advantage - Scene Challenge: Move Card
**When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage within a scene challenge,** envision your action and roll. If you act…
- With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
- With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
- With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
- With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a **hit,** you are successful. On a strong hit, take both. On a **strong hit with a match,** take both and mark progress.

On a **weak hit,** choose one.
- Take +2 momentum
- Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)

On a **miss,** you fail or your assumptions betray you. Fill a clock segment and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]]. On a **miss with a match,** fill two segments and [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price]].
