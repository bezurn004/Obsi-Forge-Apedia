> [!note] Ability 1
> - [x] When you defeat a notable foe, envision the trophy you take. Then, add it to a list of trophies on display in your ship’s vault.
> When you make a move to overcome an obstacle or hazard aboard ship, you may use the imbued power of a trophy to reroll any dice.
> 	If you do, mark that trophy’s power as spent. ^Ability1
___
> [!info] Ability 2
> - [ ] As above, and if you use a trophy to reroll all dice and score a **strong hit with a match,** the legacy of that object favors you; mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track, and do not mark the trophy as spent.
> - If you instead score a **miss with a match,** envision the cursed legacy that now haunts you. ^Ability2
___
> [!todo] Ability 3
> - [ ] When you give a tour of the vault and make a move in that space to impress or intimidate, add +2 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
