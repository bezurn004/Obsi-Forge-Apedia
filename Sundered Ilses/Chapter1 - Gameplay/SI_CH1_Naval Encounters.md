# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Naval Encounters
Yours is not the only ship among the isles. A ==naval encounter== is triggered when your intentions, the outcome of a move, or the result of an oracle roll reveal the presence of another ship or force at sea. For example:
- You roll on the _[[SI_CH3_Seafaring Waypoints|Seafaring Waypoints (SI Oracles)]]_ table (page 120) as you arrive at an expedition waypoint, which randomly introduces a ship encounter.
- You roll a miss as you [[SI_CH4_Set a Course#Set a Course Move Card|Set a Course (SI Moves)]], and must [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price (SI Moves)]]. You resolve the cost by envisioning an encounter with an enemy ship en route.
- Commanding your pirate ship, you [[SI_CH4_Face Danger#Face Danger Move Card|Face Danger (SI Moves)]] to stalk an imperial trade route in search of prey. You score a hit, and envision spotting sails on the horizon.
- 
This section guides you through the phases of a seagoing encounter: ==sighting==, ==approach==, ==engagement==, and ==boarding==. You use a combination of moves, oracles, and intuition to envision the nature of the situation. If you find yourself in a fight at sea, the combat moves help resolve your actions.

The procedures and tips in this section are geared toward ship-to-ship encounters and warfare, but also largely apply to other dangerous seagoing encounters. For example, you might assault a seaside fort or fight a titanic sea beast. Modify or ignore the phases as appropriate to the nature of your foe.

Most importantly, treat these as guidelines—not rules. It can be helpful to follow these phases strictly for your first encounter or two, but you’ll soon find your own preferences. Plus, different situations deserve different levels of detail. If it’s important or interesting, give it focus. If not, gloss over it and sail on.

See the next page for a summary of the phases. To dive into details, [[#^sighting-phase|go to page 38]].

*36 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

> - ==Envision the reaction== by deciding how both sides respond.
> 
> ### APPROACH PHASE [[#^approach-phase|(PAGE 39))]]
> - ==Resolve as a single move==, using [[SI_CH4_Face Danger#Face Danger Move Card|Face Danger (SI Moves)]] or [[SI_CH4_Secure an Advantage#Secure an Advantage Move Card|Secure an Advantage (SI Moves)]], or…
> - ==Resolve as a scene challenge== for a dramatic or unusual encounter.
> 
> ### ENGAGEMENT PHASE [[#^engagement-phase|(PAGE 40)]]

> - End the fight to claim victory or count the costs.

### WHEN IT HAPPENS IN A BLUR…
When a hostile naval encounter isn’t worthy of resolving in detail, you can instead use the [[SI_CH4_Battle#Battle Move Card|Battle (SI Moves)]]. Set your objective, decide your approach, and make the roll. You can also [[SI_CH4_Battle#Battle Move Card|Battle (SI Moves)]] to quickly decide how you fare against a secondary objective, such as when you deal with escort ships protecting your primary target.

*37 NAVAL ENCOUNTERS*

> [!summary] ## SIGHTING PHASE
> Sails, ho! The ==sighting phase== begins with initial contact. Use these guidelines to help envision the nature of a naval encounter—whether it be friend or foe—and to discover what happens next. ^sighting-phase

### ENVISION THE ENVIRONMENT
The time of day and weather can influence the nature of an encounter. Use the _[[SI_CH3_Weather Oracles|Weather (SI Oracles)]]_ (page 130) to randomly generate the starting situation, or simply decide what is expected, interesting, or dramatic.

Also, consider the state of the seas and surroundings. Encounters often occur in open water, but more complex terrain provides obstacles and opportunities. Are you sailing amid rocky shoals at low tide? Does a small island lie between you and the sighted ship? Are you navigating the foreboding tangle of a ship graveyard? Use the _[[SI_CH3_Misc_Combat|Sea Battle Feature (SI Oracles)]]_ table on page 233 to add terrain and other aspects to the scene.

### IDENTIFY THE SIGHTING
Decide what you see through your spyglass using some combination of the following.
- Check your [[SI_CH1_Factions of the Isles#FACTION INFLUENCE GRID|faction influence grid]] (page 50) to decide what flag the ship or force is flying. Are they friend, foe, or neutral?
- Ask a question using the [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]] table. For example, you might use the “pick two” option to ask, “Is this a pirate hunter or an imperial merchant ship?”
- Use the _[[_SI_Ch3_Ship Oracles|Ship (SI Oracles)]]_ (page 132) to reveal details of the encounter.
- Simply decide the nature of an encounter as appropriate to the situation.

Mix and match these techniques as you like, and let the framing of the situation be your guide. A hostile encounter is likely if you rolled a miss on a preceding move, while a strong hit on that move can prompt a neutral or beneficial encounter. Most importantly, go with your gut. Don’t get mired in an endless series of oracle rolls. 

If foul conditions—darkness, fog, storms, or mystical effects—preclude a clear view of the other ship, limit what you learn at a distance. Will you sail closer to reveal their identity? Will they give you a choice in the matter?

### SET YOUR ORIENTATION
Is this sighting at a distance, or is it a sudden, unexpected encounter that has you in range of enemy guns? In ideal conditions, ships are first sighted as sails on the horizon, but weather, obscuring terrain, and the dreadful powers of supernatural foes can all have an influence. Let the nature of the conditions, the characteristics of the ships, and the outcome of the preceding move help dictate whether the start of the encounter favors you or has you scrambling to react. If unsure, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]].

### ENVISION THE REACTION
Finally, decide if and how the encounter proceeds. Does the other ship or force move to engage? Do they flee? Do they sail blissfully onwards, unaware or unconcerned? If unsure, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]]. Then, decide how you respond. If either ship seeks to close on the other, begin the approach phase. 

*38 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

> [!info] ## APPROACH PHASE
> Make full sail! In the ==approach phase==, you and your potential foes seek the advantage of wind and sea as you close into cannon range or take part in a pursuit. This phase is a precursor to combat, encompassing minutes, hours, or even days. It is resolved through a single move or as a scene challenge. ^approach-phase

### RESOLVE AS A SINGLE MOVE
[[SI_CH4_Face Danger#Face Danger Move Card|Face Danger (SI Moves)]] or [[SI_CH4_Secure an Advantage#Secure an Advantage Move Card|Secure an Advantage (SI Moves)]] to zoom out and resolve this phase in a single move. This is the suggested approach for most naval encounters. First, decide your intent according to the details established in the sighting phase. Will you lay in wait, close, pursue, or escape? Then, make the move to see what happens.
- [[SI_CH4_Face Danger#Face Danger Move Card|Face Danger (SI Moves)]] if your starting position is unfavorable—you are caught at anchor and must hastily get underway, your ship is the lesser of the combatants, the wind and weather is not on your side, shoals or reefs make navigation hazardous, or some other complicating factor. You should also [[SI_CH4_Face Danger#Face Danger Move Card|Face Danger (SI Moves)]] if you seek to escape notice or outrun a pursuing foe. This move tends to force a minor cost.
- [[SI_CH4_Secure an Advantage#Secure an Advantage Move Card|Secure an Advantage (SI Moves)]] if you are lying in wait, closing, or pursuing, and the starting situation favors you. This move tends to award you with momentum.

If you are sailing with allies, everyone participates in the narration of the approach phase, and one of you makes the move. Others may make the [[SI_CH4_Aid Your Ally#Aid Your Ally Move Card|Aid Your Ally (SI Moves)]] to bolster the leader’s action, but this is best limited to one or two allies.

Resolve the move as appropriate to the situation. If you intend to escape, you sail out of reach on a hit. If you are in pursuit and score a hit, you have them in range. If the two sides are closing to engage, success or failure helps decide the costs you suffer or the advantages gained during this phase.

### RESOLVE AS A SCENE CHALLENGE
If you want to give this phase more focus for an important or unusual encounter, you can make it a [[_SI_CH4_Scene Challenges|Scene Challenges (SI)]] (page 254). This is best used when the situation allows for a dramatic, dynamic scene. The framing and outcome of the challenge depends on the intent of the two sides.
- If one side seeks to escape while the other is in pursuit, the result of the challenge decides if the encounter moves to the next phase.
- If both sides are maneuvering into cannon range, the outcome of the challenge can decide the rank for your initial objective when you [[SI_CH4_Enter the Fray#Enter the Fray Move Card|Enter the Fray (SI Moves)]]. For an evenly matched encounter, formidable can serve as the default. If you succeed in the scene challenge, you have the advantage—make your initial objective one rank lower (dangerous). If you fail, make it one higher (extreme).

> Skip this phase if the encounter begins at cannon range. For example, if your enemy is lurking in a fog bank or approaches without warning under cover of darkness, you’ll jump to the engagement phase. You should also skip this phase if the outcome is not in doubt, such as when a superior foe is in pursuit of a much slower ship.

*39 NAVAL ENCOUNTERS*

> [!progress] ## ENGAGEMENT PHASE
> Fire! In the ==engagement phase==, combat begins as you and your foes draw into weapons range. You are now bound to a world of thundering cannons, billowing smoke, shattered wood, and torn sails. You must rely on the strength of your ship, the skill of your command, and the steadfastness of your crew to survive. ^engagement-phase

### NAME YOUR ENGAGEMENT OBJECTIVE
To start, [[SI_CH4_Enter the Fray#Enter the Fray Move Card|Enter the Fray (SI Moves)]]. Per that move, the first step is to set an objective. Your engagement objective is not necessarily your overall objective for the fight. Instead, it is an objective specific to the engagement phase as each side maneuvers and attacks to gain superiority or victory. Depending on the intent of you and your foes, this phase may bring a decisive finish to the fight, or lead to a boarding action in the next phase.

Often, your engagement objective is one of the following:
- Escape the fight
- Destroy or sink your foe
- Board the enemy ship

If you have a higher level objective—a reason for this fight that goes beyond simply survival or victory—you will likely set that as a new objective in the next phase as you board the enemy ship (or are boarded by them).

> [!cite]
> You engage _Ember Rose_, a warship captained by a mortal enemy. Your main objective is to defeat that captain in single combat, but you must first endure a fusillade of cannon fire and grapple the warship for boarding. For now, you set your engagement objective: “Board Ember Rose.”

You can bundle multiple foes into a single objective, notching the challenge up a rank or two, or add additional objectives for noteworthy obstacles and goals. Does a blockade of ships stand between you and the flagship you seek to destroy? Make running the blockade its own objective. Is one of your allies determined to take out an enemy squad of marines by sniping from the crow’s nest, thus improving your chances when you board their ship? Set it as an objective for that character to pursue.

### SET THE ENGAGEMENT OBJECTIVE RANKS
Decide the challenge rank for each of your engagement objectives. As usual, your challenge rank determines the amount of ticks added or boxes filled as you mark progress during the fight. Formidable is a good baseline. If you are outgunned or outmatched, make it extreme. If you have clear superiority, make it dangerous. In situations of great disparity in power or abilities, make it troublesome or epic.

The objective rank should reflect not just the threat of your foe but the riskiness and complexity of the situation. If you find yourself in range of a mighty galleon’s cannons, escaping that enemy is a lower-ranked objective than sinking or boarding them—particularly if your ship has the advantage of speed or maneuverability.

*40 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

### SET A TENSION CLOCK
A ==[[GID_Clocks_Tension|tension clock]]== (page 238 of the _Starforged_ rulebook) can stand for your enemy’s goal when they want to accomplish something other than sinking your ship. In many cases, this is the opposite of your objective. You want to escape the pirates, but they seek to board and capture your ship. You are chasing after an enemy, and they are making full sail to lose you in a fog bank.

A tension clock can also represent a looming threat external to you and your foe.

> [!cite] 
> As you square off against a pirate vessel, you see the water swirling beneath both ships—a grim portent of a building danger. As you face costly outcomes or waste time, you fill a segment of the clock to represent the expanding maelstrom. When the clock fills, both ships are caught within its deadly pull!

Give the tension clock four segments for a typical fight, and six segments for a complex fight with a high-ranked objective or multiple objectives. If you can envision several opportunities for tension clocks, choose just one. Decide the most dramatic factor in the fight, make it a clock, and play to see what happens.

### SOUND THE ALARM
Beat to quarters! It’s time to roll some dice. Per the [[SI_CH4_Enter the Fray#Enter the Fray Move Card|Enter the Fray (SI Moves)]], you and your allies each roll a  stat as appropriate to your actions and intent. Some examples:
- Motivate the crew with an inspiring speech: roll +heart
- Take the wheel and bring the ship about: roll +edge
- Lead the gun crew by setting the proper cannon elevation: roll +wits

Your approach and stat choice as you [[SI_CH4_Enter the Fray#Enter the Fray Move Card|Enter the Fray (SI Moves)]] is often linked to the overall action taken by the ship and crew. If you are in command as your ship is lurking under cover of darkness or approaching an enemy under false colors, roll +shadow. If you hold fire until you come alongside your enemy, roll +iron. When playing with allies, the captain or character who is at the forefront of the situation can stand for this overall strategy.

*41 NAVAL ENCOUNTERS*

### ENVISION AND ACT
As the fight proceeds, envision the current situation and how you take action (if in control) or how you react to your opponent or other perils (if in a bad spot). In solo mode, your stats and moves cover your ship and your individual exploits, and you switch between those perspectives. When playing with allies, that framing may change from moment to moment as appropriate. But keep in mind that commanders of the isles are often people of action, as likely to take the wheel or hammer a plug into a leaking hull as they are to issue orders from the quarterdeck.

Some broad actions and related moves are listed below, but these are not the totality of your options. Use the fury and chaos of the fight to introduce complications and opportunities. Envision the situation, decide your action, and make the move. Let the outcome feed into the framing of the next action for you and your allies. Make things happen. See the _Starforged_ rulebook (pages 182–197) for [[_Combat Moves|combat move]] details.

| Action | When in control… | When in a bad spot … |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Motivate or command | [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card\|Gain Ground]] to deliver an inspiring speech or put a plan into action | [[SI_CH4_React Under Fire#React Under Fire Move Card\|React Under Fire]] to rally a faltering crew or rethink a plan under pressure |
| Maneuver the ship | [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card\|Gain Ground]] to get the ship in firing position, close or gain distance on an enemy, or press your advantage | [[SI_CH4_React Under Fire#React Under Fire Move Card\|React Under Fire]] to get out of the line of fire, sustain an attack, regain control in rough seas, or avoid a collision |
| Maneuver on foot | [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card\|Gain Ground]] to reach an advantageous position, protected station, or vantage point | [[MV_React Under Fire\|React Under Fire]] to get to another area of the ship, climb the rigging under pressure, or evade a hazard such as broken rigging or flying shrapnel |
| Set sails | [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card\|Gain Ground]] to adjust the sails to aid in speed or maneuvering | [[SI_CH4_React Under Fire#React Under Fire Move Card\|React Under Fire]] to set the sails amid enemy salvos or to avoid stress on the sails or rigging |
| Damage control | [[SI_CH4_Repair#Repair Move Card\|Repair]] in a controlled situation | [[SI_CH4_React Under Fire#React Under Fire Move Card\|React Under Fire]] to forestall imminent damage, or Repair amid hazards such as flooding or enemy fire |
| Mend wounds | [[SI_CH4_Heal#Heal Move Card\|Heal]] to tend to the wounded in a controlled situation | [[SI_CH4_Heal#Heal Move Card\|Heal]] to tend to the wounded in a chaotic environment or without preparation or equipment |
| Ready cannons | [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card\|Gain Ground]] to ready special ammunition, hold for maximum effect, or line up a precise shot | [[SI_CH4_React Under Fire#React Under Fire Move Card\|React Under Fire]] to reload or reorient the guns amid enemy fire or other hazards |
| Fire cannons | [[SI_CH4_Strike#Strike Move Card\|Strike]] to fire from a position of advantage | [[SI_CH4_Clash#Clash Move Card\|Clash]] to exchange fire from a neutral or disadvantaged position |
| Fire small arms | [[SI_CH4_Strike#Strike Move Card\|Strike]] to snipe at key targets from a secure position | [[SI_CH4_Clash#Clash Move Card\|Clash]] to exchange fire with enemy sharpshooters or under enemy cannon fire |
| Ram | [[SI_CH4_Strike#Strike Move Card\|Strike]] to ram using a controlled maneuver | [[SI_CH4_Clash#Clash Move Card\|Clash]] to ram in a desperate situation |

> ### CONTROLLING THE WEATHER GAUGE
> In nautical terms, a fighting vessel that gains an advantageous position over another—generally upwind—is said to have the weather gauge. A ship with the weather gauge can better control the distance and orientation of the combatants, perhaps even bringing its guns to bear while denying their foes a line of fire.
> 
> The weather gauge can inform the fiction as you envision and resolve moves in the approach phase. Then, when maneuvering your ship in the engagement phase, you can think of your position—in control or in a bad spot—as a measure of the weather gauge. If you have the gauge, you can [[SI_CH4_Gain Ground#Gain Ground Move Card|Gain Ground (SI Moves)]] to gain advantage or line up a shot, and [[SI_CH4_Strike#Strike Move Card|Strike (SI Moves)]] from a superior position. If you lose the gauge, you have limited maneuverability and may be exposed to enemy fire, forcing you to [[SI_CH4_React Under Fire#React Under Fire Move Card|React Under Fire (SI Moves)]] or [[SI_CH4_Clash#Clash Move Card|Clash (SI Moves)]].
> 
> This dance of wind and sail is only one aspect of the fight, but can help provide context and add a sense of seafaring authenticity to your actions.

*42 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

### MANAGE THE CHANGING TIDE OF BATTLE
Your fate in a fight is as capricious as the sea, and your objectives can change in the midst of the battle. For example, if your ship suffers grievous damage, you might decide your best course of action is to cut your losses. You would then [[SI_CH4_Face Defeat#Face Defeat Move Card|Face Defeat (SI Moves)]] on your original objective, setting a new objective to escape.

Filling a tension clock can also trigger a dramatic change in the scene, forcing you to adapt your objectives and deal with new complications as the fight continues.

> [!cite] 
> You are escorting a defenseless tradeship through a narrow strait known as the Devil’s Spine. The channel is protected by an enemy fort that has you in range of its cannons. You name your objective—_Escape the Spine_—and set a tension clock to represent the tradeship’s seaworthiness. Unfortunately, the tension clock is soon filled. The tradeship is crippled and sinking. You keep your original objective, but add a new one that must be completed first: _Evacuate the Tradeship’s Crew_. You also set a new tension clock to track the final fate of the tradeship. Can you rescue the sailors before their ship sinks, all while facing constant bombardment from the fort?

### RESOLVE THE ENGAGEMENT
This phase ends when all engagement objectives are resolved as you [[SI_CH4_Face Defeat#Face Defeat Move Card|Face Defeat (SI Moves)]] or [[SI_CH4_Take Decisive Action#Take Decisive Action Move Card|Take Decisive Action (SI Moves)]]. If the battle is done, decide your next steps. If either side sought to board the other and is successful, the fight continues in the next phase.

> [!cite] 
> You set a tension clock for the pirates who seek to seize your ship. The clock is filled during the fight, signaling that you are grappled. You must [[SI_CH4_Face Defeat#Face Defeat Move Card|Face Defeat (SI Moves)]] in your objective to _Escape the Pirates_ and muster your crew to repel boarders. 

*43 NAVAL ENCOUNTERS*

> [!danger] ## BOARDING PHASE
> Prepare for boarding! In the ==boarding phase==, you and your crew raid an enemy vessel or fort, or resist those who seek to claim victory on the decks of your own ship. Armed with blade, musket, and resolute spirit, you fight to seize your objectives. ^boarding-phase

### SET THE SCENE
Envision how the boarding action begins. In a ship-to-ship fight, boarding is accomplished by coming alongside the other ship, securing it with grappling hooks, and climbing over the gunwales or—for a more dramatic entrance—swinging across to land on the opponent’s deck. A boarding party can also use small boats to reach a disabled or unaware ship, tossing grappling hooks to climb up and begin the assault. In a fantastical campaign, boarding might begin with supernatural manifestations, aerial assaults, or raids by seaborne creatures.

If your ship is boarded by the enemy, do you commit to the battle? If you surrender, envision how they respond. If they won’t accept your surrender without convincing or conceding, make the [[SI_CH4_Compel#Compel Move Card|Compel (SI Moves)]] to see what happens. But if you intend to stand against them, you must again [[SI_CH4_Enter the Fray#Enter the Fray Move Card|Enter the Fray (SI Moves)]]. You made this move once already at the start of the engagement phase, but it’s time to clear the deck and set the context of the new scale and perspective.

### NAME YOUR BOARDING OBJECTIVES
If you achieved your objectives in the engagement phase, your boarding objective is your main goal for the fight—the task that set you against the enemy in the first place. 

> [!cite] 
> You seek the Golden Gyre, an ancient astrolabe said to guide its bearer to a long-lost treasure. The Gyre is held by a notorious privateer whose flagship you fought and successfully grappled. As you gather your boarding party, you set your objective for this phase of the fight: _Seize the Gyre_.

If you must repel boarders as a consequence or cost of the engagement phase, consider what your enemy seeks. Do they want to seize your ship? Take your cargo? Capture an important person or object? Do you even know their purpose? Set your objective to oppose their own goal—or simply to resist or escape the boarding.

As with the engagement phase, you can set multiple objectives for complex and perilous situations, and an ally might have their own individual goal.

### SET THE BOARDING OBJECTIVE RANKS
Use formidable as your baseline challenge rank for your boarding objective, and adjust up or down to reflect circumstances. If you inflicted heavy damage against the enemy in the engagement phase while sustaining few costs yourself, knock the rank down a peg. But if you suffered defeats and begin this phase at a disadvantage, increase the challenge. If unsure, choose two possible ranks, set the higher as likely, and [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]].

*44 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

### LEAP INTO ACTION
To set your position at the start of the scene, you and your allies roll to [[SI_CH4_Enter the Fray#Enter the Fray Move Card|Enter the Fray (SI Moves)]]. Decide your approach, make the roll, and put the fight in motion.

### JOIN THE FIGHT
Envision your actions and reactions, make moves when they are triggered, and use the outcomes of those moves to drive the opportunities, complications, and hardships you encounter. Envision yourself amid the chaos of the fight: volleys of musket fire, pitching decks, battle cries, desperate clashes of sword, axe, and cudgel—perhaps even fires, flooding, and falling rigging as one ship or another tears itself apart.

> [!tip]  Group Play
> If you are playing with allies, you can work to achieve varying objectives or defend or attack different areas of either ship. Keep the spotlight moving between characters to give each their due. In solo mode, focus on your objectives and treat the larger battle as frenetic background detail. Tension clocks are a handy tool to manage aspects of a boarding action beyond your command or control, such as when your crew tries to hold back attackers while you are otherwise occupied.

Pile on the drama and intensity, zooming in to give focus to key moments. One technique for highlighting an important event or encounter is to create a new objective. For example, when you come up against an officer of the enemy ship and square off against them, set a new objective to win the duel. Much as side quests can add interesting twists and turns to your character’s larger story, a new objective in a fight builds danger and excitement.

### END THE FIGHT
When your last remaining objective is won or lost, the fight is done. What comes next? Were you victorious, advancing your goals and building your reputation? Was this a pyrrhic victory, forcing you to count the costs? Or were you soundly defeated—perhaps even facing the ultimate setback as your ship is sunk, wrecked, or seized? Let the fights’ aftermath expand like ripples to deepen your character’s story.
