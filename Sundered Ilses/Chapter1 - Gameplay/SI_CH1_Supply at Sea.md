# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Supply at Sea
If you command a ship in the _Sundered Isles_, you have two types of supply. Each has a value of 0 to 5.

==Hold supply== represents shipwide resources such as food and water, rum, gear and tools, weapons for the crew, ammo and powder for the cannons, oil for the lamps, and wood and sailcloth for repairs. It measures your level of readiness for seagoing journeys and naval combat, and your ability to keep the crew provisioned and equipped. If you find yourself commanding multiple ships, the single hold supply value measures your fleetwide readiness.

==Equipped supply== represents readiness among you and your allies: gear, weapons and ammo, and provisions when going ashore. Think of it as your personal supply—the things you and your allies count among your equipment and belongings at hand.

Both values are shared between you and your allies. If you or an ally make a move to increase supply, or suffer the result of an outcome that reduces supply, everyone adjusts the appropriate meter on their character sheets.

## MANAGING SUPPLY
With a few exceptions, moves and assets don’t specifically reference your hold supply and equipped supply. Instead, as with core _Starforged_, they just refer to “supply.” When you make a move that prompts you to roll or add supply, or suffer a loss of supply, look to the fiction to decide if the action uses your hold supply or equipped supply. They should not be combined in the same move. Some examples:

| **Move** | **Hold Supply** | **Equipped Supply** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[SI_CH4_Set a Course#Set a Course Move Card\|Set a Course]] | Sail along a known route in your ship | Journey overland along a known path |
| [[SI_CH4_Resupply#Resupply Move Card\|Resupply]] | Scavenge supplies from a wrecked ship | Gather musket shot from a fallen foe |
| [[SI_CH4_Check Your Gear#Check Your Gear Move Card\|Check Your Gear]] | Check the ship’s stores for rum | Check for a torch when delving a cave |
| [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources#Sacrifice Resources Move Card\|Sacrifice Resources]] | Expend cannon shot in a broadside volley | Drop provisions while running from a jungle cat |

A simpler way to think about it: the small-scale resources you and your allies carry are equipped supply, and the large-scale resources in your ship’s stores and armory are hold supply. You usually use your equipped supply to resolve actions and suffer outcomes when taking individual action, and your hold supply when taking shipwide actions. If unsure, use whichever favors you in that situation.

### TRACKING SUPPLY
Small wooden cubes—available in craft stores—are a pleasingly thematic way to measure your current hold supply, with each cube counting as one supply. Or download the illustrated Sundered Isles character sheet from ironswornrpg.com, which includes dedicated places for both supply values.

### MARKING UNPREPARED
Since hold supply and equipped supply are tracked separately, each has its potential to make you unprepared. If either meter falls to zero, suffer the unprepared impact. If both fall to zero, mark the second unprepared as an extra impact. You must [[SI_CH4_Resupply#Resupply Move Card|Resupply (SI Moves)]] to clear an unprepared impact, but clear only one instance of unprepared through a single Resupply action.

If your ship is lost, your hold supply is lost along with it. You don’t mark unprepared, but you won’t have access to hold supply until you gain a new ship. If you transfer your command from one ship to another, keep your current hold supply.

### CONNECTING SUPPLY TO THE FICTION
Supply is mainly abstracted. You aren’t counting individual barrels of grog or musket shot. However, it’s useful to think in terms of specific resources affected. This helps you envision opportunities and perils with greater context. If you [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources#Sacrifice Resources Move Card|Sacrifice Resources (SI Moves)]], what do you lose or what shortfall is most pressing? If you Resupply, what do you gain?
> [!cite] 
> You roll a miss as you Undertake an Expedition, and envision your ship stranded amid stagnant winds and sweltering heat. You [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources#Sacrifice Resources Move Card|Sacrifice Resources (SI Moves)]] as the last of the fresh water is rationed out, reduce your hold supply to 0, and mark unprepared. Once the wind returns, you’ll need to travel to one of the nearby islands and go ashore to find a source of fresh water to [[SI_CH4_Resupply#Resupply Move Card|Resupply (SI Moves)]].

### DRAWING EQUIPPED SUPPLY FROM HOLD SUPPLY
The _Sundered Isles_ version of the [[SI_CH4_Resupply#Resupply Move Card|Resupply (SI Moves)]] includes an option to “Gear up from your ship’s stores.” This represents drawing from your hold supply to bolster your equipped supply, such as readying your provisions for an overland trek, or procuring weapons and ammo from the ship’s armory. Following the move prompts, roll +supply (hold) and resolve the outcome as follows:
- **On a strong hit**, take the boost to your equipped supply. Hold supply is unaffected.
- **On a weak hit**, you gain equipped supply, but “you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand.” The obvious cost is to [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources#Sacrifice Resources Move Card|Sacrifice Resources (SI Moves)]], suffering -1 to your hold supply. You are draining one resource to bolster another.
- **On a miss**, you don’t boost your equipped supply, and the situation worsens. Perhaps this wastes time or leaves you disadvantaged, and you [[SI_CH4_Lose Momentum#Lose Momentum Move Card|Lose Momentum (SI Moves)]]. Or you face an issue with your supply that creates a new complication.

> Hold supply is an extra resource to aid your actions and mitigate failure. To keep the pressure on, depict a dramatic world of struggle and scarcity. Let costly outcomes force you to [[SI_CH4_Sacrifice Resources#Sacrifice Resources Move Card|Sacrifice Resources (SI Moves)]]. Don’t go easy. Stay hungry.
