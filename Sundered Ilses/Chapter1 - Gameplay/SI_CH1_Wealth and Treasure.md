# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Wealth and Treasure
By default, gameplay in _Starforged_ and _Sundered Isles_ isn’t concerned with acquiring riches or counting coins. Money is—at most—a narrative means to an end. The economies of these worlds are largely built upon barter and favors, and your personal wherewithal is abstracted within your supply meters and the progression through your legacy tracks.

However, _Sundered Isles_ adds crewed ships to the mix, and funding their upkeep can help drive challenges and opportunities in  your story. What’s more, taking from those in power, bleeding the empires dry, redirecting those resources to your own ends—those pursuits are worth their weight in gold. If you want to give the ebb and flow of wealth more focus in your campaign, use the optional guidelines detailed below.

## MANAGING YOUR TREASURY
Your ==treasury== is a reserve of money, goods, and valuables. It is distinct from your personal supply and [[SI_CH1_Supply at Sea|hold supply]] (page 26), which represent equipment and provisions on hand. It is used to maintain your crew and ship, make purchases, gain or grant favors, and pay off debts. The items in your treasury might be received as payment, found in the course of your adventures, or plundered from your foes.

The resources held in your treasury are inventoried in your ledger. The _Sundered Isles Playkit_, available for download at ironswornrpg.com, includes a ledger worksheet.

### ACQUIRING WEALTH
When you acquire something of worth—whether a stockpile of trade goods, a payment from a patron or benefactor, a chest filled with gold, or a captured ship—give it a value ranging from 1 to 5 points. See the table below for examples.

| Value | Examples |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | Mundane trade goods or supplies, routine payment, scavenged item, unremarkable relic |
| 2 | Valuable trade goods, reasonable payment, finely-crafted item, small cache of valuables, minor relic |
| 3 | Exceptional trade goods, generous payment, exceptional item, large cache of valuables, rare relic |
| 4 | Minor prize ship, excessive payment, masterwork item, impressive collection of valuables, precious relic |
| 5 | Major prize ship, huge payment, incomparable item, bountiful stockpile of valuables, wondrous relic |

These values are abstracted. Five ledger items of 1 value do not necessarily equal a single item with a worth of 5, but can be treated that way for the sake of simplicity.

## UPDATING YOUR LEDGER
Record new acquisitions in your ledger. Each row of the ledger includes five circles. Note an item’s value by marking a + symbol in those circles—one marked circle for each point of value. When you spend or sacrifice value from your treasury, fill in the circle to represent what was lost. When an item is fully spent, draw a line through its entry or put a checkmark or X in the box beside it.

> - [ ] Coffee [+]
> - [ ] Payment in coin for passage to Dagger Isle [X][x]
> - [ ] Prize ship (The Tide Chaser) [+][+][+][+]
> - [x] Strongbox full of rubies [X][X][X]

## SPENDING WEALTH
Exchange items or spend funds from your treasury as best fits the narrative. Dipping into your treasury doesn’t add mechanical bonuses to a move, nor is it (usually) an excuse to skip moves altogether. Any action that has you seeking resources, services, or favors from a character or organization is likely to carry a cost. For example:

- You commission repairs at a dockyard; this allows you to select “At a Facility” when making the [[SI_CH4_Repair#Repair Move Card|Repair (SI Moves)]].
- You hire a local guide to help show the way on an overland journey; this allows you to [[SI_CH4_Set a Course#Set a Course Move Card|Set a Course (SI Moves)]] instead of [[SI_CH4_Undertake an Expedition#Undertake an Expedition Move Card|Undertake an Expedition (SI Moves)]] when you set off.
- While low on provisions, you encounter a friendly ship and offer to swap the trade goods in your hold for food and fresh water; this allows you to attempt a [[SI_CH4_Resupply#Resupply Move Card|Resupply (SI Moves)]],
- You want to make your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] more impressive, so you hire local artisans to outfit the ship with fine fittings and furnishings; this—along with spent experience—allows you to gain the [[AST_Gilded Adornment|GILDED ADORNMENT]] module asset as you [[SI_CH4_Advance#Advance Move Card|Advance (SI Moves)]].

The narrative framing helps determine if a move is necessary, what is required to make the move, and what you gain or lose. Does the context of the action and your approach require that you expend some wealth? If so, decide the cost and mark it off.

> [!cite]
> You arrive at an imperial port with a hold full of smuggled weapons, ready for delivery to an underground resistance group. However, you must first avoid the attention of port officials. You visit the harbor master’s office, a pouch of flawless pearls in hand (value 2), and Compel them to look the other way as you offload the armaments.

When money is involved, your treasury can also help resolve a costly outcome.

> [!cite] 
> You score a weak hit as you make your offer to the harbor master. Per the outcome of that move, “their agreement comes with a demand or complication.” It seems the official is not satisfied with the bribe. Luckily you came prepared and sweeten the pot with a weighty bag of coin (value 2).

### CONVERTING WEALTH
Readily spendable valuables such as coins, stockpiles of trade goods, or stacks of metal ingots are often used piecemeal. For example, if you receive a payment of value 3 in coinage, it’s a simple matter to spend 1 portion of this ledger item, reducing its value to 2. However, other items aren’t so easily dealt with in increments.

If you have an opportunity to convert an item in your ledger to a more readily-spendable or tradeable resource, clear the old entry and add a new one. In typical cases, you should make the value of the new item one step lower (minimum 1) to reflect the inherent cost of the exchange. 

> [!cite] 
> You visit a port city with a war prize, a captured frigate, in tow. You offload the value 4 vessel to a black market shipbroker, and add a new entry (“coin paid for captured frigate”) to your ledger, giving it a value of 3.


Not all resources are in demand in all places. An inland village has little need of a ship. A rare curio may require a very particular buyer. If you’re not sure if a ledger item is spendable or exchangeable at a specific location, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]].

### WANT SOMETHING SIMPLER?
If you prefer not to fuss with individual items in a ledger, you can keep a running total for your treasury. When you claim an item, add its value to the total. When you spend, barter, or sacrifice a portion of your treasury, reduce your total. Alternatively, you can treat any readily spendable resources such as coins as a lump sum, and save the ledger for unique items of note.

## DEALING WITH UPKEEP
Your ==upkeep== is an ongoing cost for maintaining your ships and outfitting your crew. 

### SETTING YOUR UPKEEP
Based on the size of your ship or fleet, use the table shown here to set your base upkeep. If any unusual aspects of your holdings make your upkeep more expensive, increase this cost by a point or two. For example, if you add a pricey specialist aboard your small ship, make your upkeep 2 instead of 1. There is a spot on your ledger to record your current upkeep.

### PAYING UPKEEP
Upkeep is typically spent as you Sojourn, and covers the other moves you make during the layover to rest and refit. You can also consider your upkeep as the base cost for periodic shares to your crew. Anytime you seek to reward those under your command or gain favor, mark off the cost in upkeep. If you cannot pay upkeep, your crew will grow discontent and your ship will fall out of repair. You need to seek out the means of bolstering your treasury—take a job, chase down rumors of a hidden treasure, or plunder fat imperial targets.

*30 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

## MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS?
At the start of the campaign, you are likely an upstart character scrambling to survive. Your sworn quests are the focus, but financial resources are an unfortunate aspect of keeping your ship afloat and crew paid.

However, once you gain a modicum of wealth and influence, your focus may shift from the grind of subsistence to larger concerns. If your treasury and ledger feel like a foregone conclusion—unnecessary busywork—then you are ready to move on. It’s no longer a question of whether you can afford a bribe for the harbormaster, but whether that bribe goes unnoticed or causes new troubles.

In particular, acquiring a large treasure hoard or wondrous artifact can upend your campaign. How do you keep it a secret? What other people and factions are hunting for it? How will you use it to serve your iron vows? Let the discovery drive new opportunities and complications in your story.

## THE LURE OF TREASURE
There are treasures among the isles: coins of gold and silver, glittering gems, lustrous pearls, masterwork crafts, and ancient artifacts.

Many of these treasures originate from the distant continental domain. Over decades, as wars and calamities swept over those lands, riches were taken as spoils, smuggled out amidst coups or rebellions, or greedily hoarded by imperial powers. These treasures followed various paths of fortune and misfortune as they made their way to the isles—taken and retaken in war, squirreled away in vaults, captured by pirates, buried in hidden places, or sunk to the depths. Much of the wealth of this golden exodus is still out there—waiting to be reclaimed or seized.

Other treasures are born of the isles. They are crafted or gathered by far-flung people or retrieved from ancient places. The treasures of ancient civilizations are sometimes claimed by the true inheritors of those fortunes, but are more often stolen by imperial powers and other looters.

### REVEALING TREASURES
Searching for a fabled treasure or capturing a powerful treasure ship can serve as the object of a quest. You can also discover treasures as prompted by an oracle table, such as among the [[SI_CH3_Ship Boarding|cargo of a captured ship]] (page 139). To reveal the contents and nature of a treasure, use the [[_SI_CH3_Treasure Oracles|Treature (SI Oracles)]] (page 220).

A relatively mundane discovery can temporarily bolster your treasury, while a significant haul can change the course of your  adventures—for better or worse.

### CURSED RICHES
Greed is a corrupting force, and not all treasures bring good fortune. Your [[SI_CH3_The Cursed Die|cursed die]] (page 114) can reveal uncanny aspects of a treasure. Some riches are corrupted by foul magic. Others are bound to dreadful hauntings. The consuming lust for treasure has seen people broken, ships and crews lost to the depths—even entire nations condemned to ruin. Be wary of the allure of riches, lest you find yourself on that same doomed course.
