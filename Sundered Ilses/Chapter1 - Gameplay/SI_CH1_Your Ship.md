# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Your Ship
Ships of the isles range from single-masted cutters to fearsome multi-decked titans. A typical warship is [[#^example-ship|detailed on]] pages 20–21, and you can generate ship features using the [[_SI_Ch3_Ship Oracles|Ship (SI Oracles)]] (page 132)].

Imperial powers harness the might of these ships to gain dominion over the isles, but independent people, smugglers, free traders, pirates, and other powers helm their own vessels. You are among them, and the ship you command is more than a means of getting from one place to another. It is freedom. It is home.

The ships you sail and encounter should reflect the nature of your truths, which you select in the campaign launch exercises. By default, this is an age of sail. But the people of your setting might face an age of industrialization, with iron-hulled warships and submersibles stalking seagoing passages. You might set sail in skyships—or even into the great aetherial tides beyond your own world. Envision the ships of your version of the isles as mundane or as fantastic as you like.

## DAMAGE AND REPAIR
As in _Starforged_, your ship has a single status meter—its integrity. When a ship you command faces damage from an attack or hazard, make the [[SI_CH4_Withstand Damage#Withstand Damage Move Card|Withstand Damage (SI Moves)]] to see how it fares. See [[SI_CH4_Withstand Damage#Withstand Damage Move Card|Withstand Damage (SI Moves)]] on page 206 in the _Starforged_ rulebook for details. To get your ship seaworthy again, make the [[SI_CH4_Repair#Repair Move Card|Repair (SI Moves)]] move. This move applies if you conduct damage control in a crisis, make repairs while underway or at anchor, or commission repairs in port.

If you’d like some flavor for the nature of ship damage, especially when you face a hard hit or dramatic situation, check the [[SI_CH3_Misc_Combat|Ship Damage (SI Oracles)]] (page 233)]. If the problem isn’t dealt with, step up the severity. When you [[SI_CH4_Repair#Repair Move Card|Repair (SI Moves)]], use the “repair any other component or device” option to fix critical damage to a part of your ship.

*16 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLE*

## SHIP ASSETS
As with core _Starforged_, your _Sundered Isles_ asset deck includes ship-related asset categories: the ==command vehicle==, ==modules==, and ==support vehicles==. In addition, you start your campaign with an ==incidental vehicle==, the [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]].

### THE SAILING SHIP
By default, you begin your adventures in command of an incidental vehicle, the [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]]. This ship is likely a perfectly seaworthy vessel, but it’s not truly yours. It is a waypoint in your character’s story, a transition to better things. Eventually, you find your way to your heart’s true desire, [[#YOUR FLAGSHIP|your FLAGSHIP]] (page 18).

The [SAILING SHIP] is not a character asset. It is not purchased with experience, does not have upgradeable abilities, cannot be enhanced with modules, and is not marked as battered or cursed to offset potential destruction. It is provided as a card in the _Sundered Isles_ asset deck for ease of reference, but the card is not necessary for play. You just need a place to track your ship’s integrity as you suffer damage and undertake repairs.

Because of the relative fragility of an incidental vehicle—both mechanically and narratively—you might find yourself losing one [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]] and claiming another through the course of your adventures. A [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]] can even come into play after you’ve earned your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]]. You might take command of another ship for a specific mission, or find yourself with a new—but perhaps temporary—vessel if your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] is destroyed or lost. In other words, the [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]] is a tool to represent vessels with a  limited role in your story, or as a stand-in for a ship yet to be upgraded to a command vehicle.

In the campaign launch exercises, you envision how you gained command of the [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]] and decide some aspects of its nature. If you want to portray a more seasoned commander, you have an option to instead begin with a [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]].

> An ally can also take a [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]] as their own command, serving as an escort for the [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] or setting off on a secondary task. But this is best limited to unusual situations so you don’t spend the entirety of your campaign waving at each other from a distance. By default, you are fellow members of the command team on your ship. You can learn more about [[SI_CH1_Command and Crews|Command and Crews]] on page 22.

*17 YOUR SHIP*

## YOUR FLAGSHIP
This is your _Sundered Isles_ ==command vehicle==, purchased with experience when you [[SI_CH4_Advance|Advance (SI Moves)]]. It might be gained as a gift from a patron, captured as a prize in battle, claimed as a salvaged wreck, or purchased with hard-won treasure. You might even promote  your incidental vehicle to [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] status, giving it more importance and capabilities in your story.

Your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] max integrity is 5, and it can be marked ==battered== or ==cursed== to avoid a potentially decisive roll on the [[SF_CH3_Withstand Damage#^table-miss|Withstand Damage table]]. See [[SF_CH1_Impacts#Vehicle Troubles|Vehicle trouble]] on page 51 in the _Starforged_ rulebook to learn more about these debilities. To explore a typical [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] of the isles, see [[#^example-ship|an example ship]] on pages 20–21. 

> Do you command a speedy but undergunned sloop? A powerful frigate? An imposing multi-decked titan? All command vehicles have the same mechanical attributes, but the nature of your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] should affect the rank of challenges and how you  interpret actions and outcomes. In addition, you can add modules to better represent the capabilities and quirks of your ship.

*18 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

### MODULES
==Modules== are linked to your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] and offer additional options and advantages when sailing that ship.

Your _Sundered Isles_ asset deck includes an array of seafaring modules, from the mundane (an [[AST_Improved Hold|IMPROVED HOLD]]) to the fantastic (a [[AST_Submersible Mode|SUBMERSIBLE MODE]]). A module can represent a feature gained during a refit in port, a modification made by you or your crew, or an aspect of your ship that you’ve learned to exploit.

When you [[SI_CH4_Withstand Damage#Withstand Damage Move Card|Withstand Damage (SI Moves)]] and score a miss, you can mark a module as broken to offset further danger for your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]]. Flip the card over to indicate its broken state. A broken module cannot be used until you successfully [[SI_CH4_Repair#Repair Move Card|Repair (SI Moves)]] it.

> [!example]- ARMORED PROW [module]
> ![[AST_Armored Prow#^Header]]
> ![[AST_Armored Prow#^Ability1]]
> ![[AST_Armored Prow#^Ability2]]
> ![[AST_Armored Prow#^Ability3]]

### SUPPORT VEHICLES
==Support vehicles== are secondary vehicles, generally carried and launched from your [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]] or [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]].

Your _Sundered Isles_ asset deck includes four support vehicles: a [[AST_Longboat|LONGBOAT]] for going ashore or ferrying people or cargo from one ship to another, a [[AST_Diving Bell|DIVING BELL]] for exploring the depths, a wondrous [[AST_Flying Machine|FLYING MACHINE]] for aerial missions, and a [[AST_Captain's Boat|CAPTAIN'S BOAT]] for arriving in style.

Each support vehicle has an integrity meter. When a support vehicle takes a hit or faces a damaging situation, [[SI_CH4_Withstand Damage#Withstand Damage Move Card|Withstand Damage (SI Moves)]] to see how it fares. As directed by that move, you can mark ==battered== to avoid potential calamitous destruction. Make the [[SI_CH4_Repair#Repair Move Card|Repair (SI Moves)]] to clear the battered impact and restore lost integrity.

To learn more about modules and support vehicles, see [[SF_CH1_Assets#Asset Types|Asset types]] on pages 55–56 of the _Starforged_ rulebook.
