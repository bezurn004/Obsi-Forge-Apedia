# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Command and Crews
If you are in command of a ship, you need a crew. If it’s a small ship, you can manage with a handful of crewmembers. But you likely need a crew of dozens or even hundreds for a larger vessel. Crewmembers work the rigging, man the cannons, undertake boarding actions, defend the decks, make repairs, keep watch, and help manage the routine necessities of life aboard ship.

However, the crew is not given mechanical detail. They are largely abstracted as part of your own actions and the inherent aspects of your ship.

## YOUR SHIPBOARD ROLE
If you play solo and have a ship, you are its captain. If you play with allies, one of you is the captain unless you envision a ship and culture with communal leadership. In any case, work to ensure the other characters have a say in the operation of the ship. Non-imperial vessels in the isles rarely adhere to a strict chain of command—there’s no need to fuss with military rank and discipline.

Beyond the role of captain, you and your allies can take on fitting duties such as quartermaster, carpenter, gunner, surgeon, cook, musician, or navigator. In a more fantastic campaign, a character might serve as the ship’s soothsayer, dragon-wrangler, or ghost-hunter. But you are broadly capable, likely wearing a few hats for duties at sea and ashore, doing whatever needs to be done.

## ENVISIONING THE CREW
Most crewmembers go about their duties in the background, like extras in a movie. But some key sailors might come to the forefront of your story. If so, give them a name and envision a characteristic or two. For inspiration, use the [[_SI_CH3_Character Oracles|Character (SI Oracles)]] (page 186). Familiar characters add personality to the overall crew and create opportunities for your story. One or more of these might eventually gain a spotlight as a specialist with the [[#COHORT|COHORT asset]] (page 24)].

Keep in mind your crew’s mood and condition. Are you sailing with a full complement or have you suffered casualties? Are they happy and well-provisioned, or are there stirrings of discontent? Perhaps even a brewing mutiny? Notable events should influence the crew, creating opportunities and complications in your story and providing context for the rank of your challenges.

## LEADING THE CREW
The moves you make represent your individual exploits, but they also resolve actions taken by the crew and ship under your leadership. When you command, guide, or try to sway the crew in a risky or uncertain situation, make the appropriate move. Your approach, represented by your stats, is innately linked to the ship and crew.

> You roll a miss as you [[SI_CH4_Undertake an Expedition#Undertake an Expedition Move Card|Undertake an Expedition (SI Moves)]] and find yourself in the path of an approaching storm. You [[SI_CH4_Face Danger#Face Danger Move Card|Face Danger (SI Moves)]] +edge as your crew mans the sails and the ship makes speed to escape.

## CREW-RELATED ASSETS
Your _Sundered Isles_ asset deck includes several assets to spotlight your skill and notoriety as a leader, and your evolving relationship with your crew. They are [[AST_Crew Commander|CREW COMMANDER]], [[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]], [[AST_Cohort|COHORT]], and [[AST_Fleet Commander|FLEET COMMANDER]]. These assets are useful in a _Sundered Isles_ campaign or as part of a sci-fi _Starforged_ campaign with a crewed starship.

### CREW COMMANDER
The [[AST_Crew Commander|CREW COMMANDER]] asset bolsters your abilities as a leader while adding mechanical and narrative detail to interactions with the crew.

This path includes a condition meter, your command. This represents crew strength, loyalty, and morale. You start with a maximum of 4 command, which can be spent to improve the outcome of your moves or offset costly outcomes. At 0 command, this asset counts as an impact.

Restore lost command by delivering rewards to your crew, such as a significant share of a treasure or a lengthy respite.

When you [[SI_CH4_Advance|Advance (SI Moves)]] and upgrade this path, you can increase the maximum command, boosting your leadership and the strength and capabilities of the crew.

### PIRATE CAPTAIN
When you take command of a pirate crew or give focus to your career as a pirate, the [[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]] path offers boons for hunting for and seizing prizes, sharing the spoils to build rapport with your crew, and using your riches or infamy to gain an advantage when visiting ports

> [!example]- CREW COMMANDER [path]
> ![[AST_Crew Commander#^Header]]
> ![[AST_Crew Commander#^Ability1]]
> ![[AST_Crew Commander#^Ability2]]
> ![[AST_Crew Commander#^Ability3]]

> ![[AST_Pirate Captain#^Header]]
> ![[AST_Pirate Captain#^Ability1]]
> ![[AST_Pirate Captain#^Ability2]]
> ![[AST_Pirate Captain#^Ability3]]

> If you want to begin your adventures with a focus on command and crews, take an asset such as [[AST_Crew Commander|CREW COMMANDER]] as you create your character. If you’d prefer to grow into your role as a commander, add it to your kit when you [[SI_CH4_Advance#Advance Move Card|Advance (SI Moves)]].

### COHORT
By default, connections are not a crewmember. They are notable NPCs whose lives occasionally intersect with your own, and are tethers to people and places beyond your ship. They might accompany you on a specific mission, but will soon part ways as your duties and ambitions take you on separate paths.

However, the [[AST_Cohort|COHORT]] asset makes a connection part of your crew as a specialist. As with a standard connection, specialists provide bonuses when aiding you and your allies in actions specific to their role.

[[AST_Cohort|COHORT]] is a deed asset, purchased when you fulfill its condition—accepting an existing or new connection as a crewmate. Upgrade the asset to add additional specialists to your roster.

> [!example]- COHORT [deed]
> ![[AST_Cohort#^Header]]
> ![[AST_Cohort#^Ability1]]
> ![[AST_Cohort#^Ability2]]
> ![[AST_Cohort#^Ability3]]

Like a standard connection, [[AST_Cohort|COHORT]] specialists have a role and a rank. When you [[SI_CH4_Develop Your Relationship#Develop Your Relationship Move Card|Develop Your Relationship (SI Moves)]], mark progress on the connection’s progress track. When the relationship is ready to evolve, [[SI_CH4_Forge a Bond#Forge a Bond Move Card|Forge a Bond (SI Moves)]]. However, because a specialist is more accessible and active in your story, the benefits of the relationship can greatly outweigh other connections. To counter this, do the  following:
- **Give specialists a role that is specific and evocative, rather than generic and broadly useful.**
  Think of them as truly specialists, experts in a particular skill or craft. Sailor lacks flavor and offers boosts for nearly any seagoing action. Navigator is more specific, providing bonuses when undertaking seafaring expeditions. Starmarked Navigator adds setting flavor to the mix. Even better, take on specialists who might be able mariners and contribute as a crewmember, but whose roles don’t come into play every session. Ambassador, Archaeologist, Courtier, Naturalist, and Spy are interesting roles that don’t impact the routine challenges of sailing and fighting. Feel free to adjust an existing connection’s role for greater specificity or suitability when you bring them onboard as a specialist.
- **Evolve the relationship in rare and dramatic circumstances.**
  While any meaningful interaction is an opportunity to [[SI_CH4_Develop Your Relationship#Develop Your Relationship Move Card|Develop Your Relationship (SI Moves)]] with a connection, you should save this move for significant events with a specialist. Closeness makes happenings in your story less consequential. Ask yourself: is this truly important—a milestone in our relationship? If so, [[SI_CH4_Develop Your Relationship#Develop Your Relationship Move Card|Develop Your Relationship (SI Moves)]].

How do you introduce a specialist? They can be an existing crewmember, a reoccurring connection, or someone you seek out as a  new connection to serve a specific niche.

> [!cite]
> After another failed overland expedition, you decide an expert is needed, so you [[SI_CH4_Make a Connection#Make a Connection Move Card|Make a Connection (SI Moves)]] to find a guide. You score a hit and bring this new connection aboard as a member of your [[AST_Cohort|COHORT]], setting their role as Wilderness Scout.

### FLEET COMMANDER
> [!example]- FLEET COMMANDER [path]
> ![[AST_Fleet Commander#^Header]]
> ![[AST_Fleet Commander#^Ability1]]
> ![[AST_Fleet Commander#^Ability2]]
> ![[AST_Fleet Commander#^Ability3]]

Are you ready to sail with a fleet of ships at your back? [[AST_Fleet Commander|FLEET COMMANDER]] is a deed asset, purchased when you gain a
fleet through the course of your story and have at least 16 filled boxes across your legacy tracks. This is an evolution of your leadership late in your career—you are now a major player in the world.

Your fleet is tracked through a ==power== condition meter. You begin with 4 power, which serves as your stat when performing  fleetwide maneuvers or attacks. You lose power when you [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price (SI Moves)]] and suffer a cost to your fleet, such as taking casualties in a storm or battle, or facing dissent among your ships. To restore lost power, [[SI_CH4_Sojourn#Sojourn Move Card|Sojourn (SI Moves)]] and forego one of your recover moves; this represents spending time and resources to refit and recruit.

Your fleet affects your character’s influence and the challenges you face. Instead of running from a flotilla of powerful imperial warships, you can take them head-on. An epic sea beast is knocked down a rank or two. You can blockade ports and wield your fleet as a political cudgel.

But even when you have a fleet at your back, the focus of the story remains on you and your allies. In big, dramatic scenes involving your fleet, zoom in and out between fleetwide actions, your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]], and your personal exploits.

### SHIP MODULES AND THE CREW
Your [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] modules can also reflect the talents and strength of your crew, or influence the state of the crew. If your ship is [[AST_Rigged for Speed|RIGGED FOR SPEED]], the crew is skilled at adjusting the sails for maximum effect. An [[AST_Improved Sick Bay|IMPROVED SICK BAY]] helps with casualties from battle or shipwide ailments (someone poisoned the rum!).

> [!example]- RIGGED FOR SPEED [modeul]
> ![[AST_Rigged for Speed#^Header]]
> ![[AST_Rigged for Speed#^Ability1]]
> ![[AST_Rigged for Speed#^Ability2]]
> ![[AST_Rigged for Speed#^Ability3]]
