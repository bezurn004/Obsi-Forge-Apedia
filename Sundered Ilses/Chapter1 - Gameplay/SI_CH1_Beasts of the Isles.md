# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Beasts of the Isles
Here there be monsters. Within the isles, ==beasts== are creatures of a fantastic or dreadful nature. Great sharks. Dragons. Sea serpents. The Kraken. 

You decide the nature of beasts in your world when you choose the truths of the setting. In a more fantastic and dangerous version of the isles, beasts roam freely. In a grounded campaign, beasts might be real-world creatures (such as whales, giant squids, large sharks, and crocodiles), the imaginings and exaggerations of superstitious mariners, or age-old myths.

## INTRODUCING BEASTS TO YOUR WORLD
The following pages include brief summaries of notable beasts in several environs: [[#^beasts-sea|sea]] (pages 58–59), [[#^beasts-land|land]] (pages 60–61), [[#^beasts-shore-river|shore and river]] (page 62), and [[#^beasts-sky|sky]] (page 63). Use these beasts as inspiration for myths, dangers, denizens, or the focus of a quest. Feel free to pick from these lists, combine or customize, or roll for a random beast.

To unleash a truly aberrant creature upon your world, generate its form using the _Starforged_ [[_SF_CH5_Creatures|Creatures Oracle]] (page 336 of the _Starforged_ rulebook).

*56 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

## THE MUNDANE AND THE MIRACULOUS
As you travel the world, imagine a vibrant ecosystem with flora and fauna of all sorts. Oracle prompts such as _[[SI_CH3_Seafaring Details|Seafaring Details]]_ (page 122) and _[[SI_CH3_Overland Details|Overland Details (SI Oracles)]]_ (page 156) include encounters with mundane creatures, and other events such as [[SI_CH1_Interludes|Interludes]] (page 46) may inspire you to reveal new aspects of the natural world.

Use these commonplace but memorable encounters to build  Contrasts with the truly unusual, wondrous, or horrific.

## FACING TITANIC FOES
The astounding scale and power of beasts can make encounters a daunting challenge. How do you stand against an epic beast larger than the mightiest warship?

Your first and best option? Flee. But consider the flexibility of combat objectives. A single encounter can incorporate multiple lower-ranked objectives for the phases of a fight. For example, defeating a leviathan might involve separate objectives to lure the beast, slow or weaken it with tethered harpoons, and strike a deadly blow.

Or [[SI_CH4_Swear an Iron Vow#INSERT Move Card|Swear an Iron Vow (SI Moves)]] and use that quest to track your ongoing struggle against a beast across days, weeks, or months. Each desperate fight is given an objective to achieve a small victory and [[SI_CH4_Reach a Milestone#Reach a Milestone Move Card|Reach a Milestone (SI Moves)]], perhaps forcing the creature to slink away until your next meeting. These encounters build to a final dramatic confrontation where you—if the Fates allow—[[SI_CH4_Fulfill Your Vow#Fulfill Your Vow Move Card|Fulfill Your Vow (SI Moves)]].

*57 BEASTS OF THE ISLES*

> ## BEASTS OF THE SEA ^beasts-sea

| 1D100 | Name | Rank | Description |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-15 | Predatory Shark | Various Ranks | Most sharks offer little threat, but certain species of large, aggressive sharks are properly feared and respected by seagoing folk. Mariners also speak of ancient sharks, relentless hunters the size of whales whose teeth splinter hull and bone alike. |
| 16–30 | Great Whale | Various Ranks | The seas teem with whales of all sorts. Even the largest of them, the great whales, are generally friendly and curious. They are nevertheless under threat by whalers and despoilers, and some islanders sail in defense of these gentle creatures. |
| 31–35 | Leviathan | Epic | These ancient whales are far larger and more aggressive than their common kin. Their bone-white hide bears the scars of harpoon strikes and hard-won battles with other beasts. They are keenly intelligent, have long memories, and do not forgive or forget. |
| 36–40 | Rothulk | Extreme | Circling carrion birds and the stench of death often forewarn the appearance of a rothulk, a cadaverous but still animate great whale. These unfortunate beasts are infested by a multitude of parasites that bind grasping tendrils to flesh and bone. The small creatures steal the life of their host and puppeteer what remains. |
| 41–45 | Giant Squid | Formidable | The largest of these creatures can easily crush a longboat with their powerful tentacles, but they only reluctantly emerge from the lightless depths that is their preferred hunting grounds. |
| 46–50 | The Kraken | Epic | The Kraken is the singular master of the seas, a beast of horrific scale, cunning, and ferocity. It has the sleek form and speed of a giant whale, but is armed with powerful tentacles and a gaping, toothy maw. Along its flank are rows of luminescent eyes; doom lights, mariners call them, for they are a presage of certain death. |
| 51–55 | Sea Dragon | Formidable | These aquatic dragons have glittering scales, toothy jaws, and long, bladed tails. Their winglike fins propel them through the water at amazing speeds, and send them leaping and gliding over the waves. |
| 56–60 | Elder Ray | Extreme | Like their lesser brethren, these creatures have flattened bodies and broad fins. They are inherently gentle, often traveling with seafolk who recognize individual rays by their luminescent markings. |
| 61–65 | Whipneck | Formidable | These creatures are about the length of a sloop, with long necks, broad bodies, and turtle-like fins. They are not overly aggressive, but often hound fishing boats in hopes of stealing their catch. |
| 66–70 | Eel Swarm | Formidable | These masses of black-eyed, sharp-toothed eels rely on sheer numbers to overwhelm larger prey. Some say they are capable of chewing through a ship’s hull, and pour into a breached vessel in a slithering, biting torrent. |
| 71–75 | Sea Serpent | Epic | These titanic beasts have sinuous bodies, glittering scales, and spiny red fins larger than the greatest mainsail. They are largely ambivalent to the presence of most seagoing folk—all but the largest ship passes beneath their notice. |
| 76–80 | Reefstrider | Extreme | The shells of these gigantic, squat crustaceans are encrusted with coral and sea life, camouflaging them among reef systems. They are territorial and protective of their habitats. |
| 81–85 | Starlume | Dangerous | Hundreds of pinpoint lights shimmer within the translucent form of these gigantic jellyfish. According to legend, the lights of a starlume reveal complex celestial maps. Those who look deeply into those alluring lights may find themselves gifted—or cursed—with visions of lost seas and hidden places. |
| 86–90 | Vortex Forge | Epic | From a distance, this titanic entity might be mistaken for a great whale, but it is a crewless metal construct that wanders the seas on an inscrutable mission. Its rotating maw generates powerful whirlpools to draw in prey, sending ship and sailor alike into an ever-burning furnace deep within its mechanical gullet. |
| 91–95 | Herald | Epic | These colossal tortoise-like beings are the longest-lived creatures of the isles—perhaps as ancient as the world itself. Islanders interpret wondrous and grim portents from the sighting of a herald, but these creatures often go unseen; their craggy shell is easily mistaken for a small, rocky island. |
| 96–100 | Abomination | Various Ranks | Generate this beast using the _Starforged_ [[_SF_CH5_Creatures\|Creatures Oracle]] (page 336 of the _Starforged_ rulebook), giving it a water form. |

*58 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*
*59 BEASTS OF THE ISLES*

> ## BEASTS OF THE LAND ^beasts-land

| 1D100 | Name | Rank | Description |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–25 | Predatory Big Cat | Various Ranks | Big cats are the most common land predator in the isles. Some live among the high branches of jungle canopies, climbing and leaping with ease. Others dwell within the shadows of the forest floor or amid the rocks and crags of highland terrain, stalking their prey with deadly skill. |
| 26–35 | Reaper | Formidable | Reapers are bipedal, cunning reptiles who move in packs, striking unseen from the shadows and chasing prey into flanking ambushes. They dispatch their quarry with wicked, sickle-shaped claws. |
| 36–40 | Great Ape | Epic | The towering great apes of the isles live in the most rugged and remote jungles. They are reclusive creatures and do not abide rivals or trespassers. Their long lives are marked by the innumerable scars of fights with other beasts. |
| 41–45 | Thundermaw | Extreme | This bipedal reptile is feared for its towering size, toothy maw, and dreadful roar. A small circlet of bone rings the beast’s skull, leading some to name the thundermaw a king among the isles. Despite its legendary reputation, the thundermaw prefers to scavenge its meals, and tires easily when giving chase. |
| 46–50 | Primordial | Epic | This titanic, reptilian beast dwells within deep jungles and mountainous highlands. It is a creature of the ancient world, unconcerned with the petty affairs of island folk but protective of its mist-shrouded domain. It is taller than the highest jungle canopy, and leaves trails of splintered trees and sundered earth in its wake. |
| 51–55 | Avithor | Dangerous | These person-sized, flightless birds are drawn to shiny things, and collect bits of stone, metal, and trinkets in their nests. They are jealously protective of this hoard. When a trespasser comes near, they use a chittering call and display of colorful plumage to warn them away. If that fails, their surprising jumping ability, razor-like claws, and sharp beak make quick work of any threat. |
| 56–60 | Verdant Mammoth | Extreme | These majestic, nomadic creatures have prehensile trunks, long tusks, and spiraling horns. The largest and oldest of a herd, the matriarch, is covered in a layer of moss, lichen, and plant sprigs—it wears this lush garden like an elaborate, earthy cape. Birds roost along the matriarch’s back and circle above while the herd travels, providing a squawking alarm when danger is near. |
| 61–65 | Serrabrus | Formidable | The serrabrus is a large boar-like beast. It is an industrious creature, felling trees, gathering deadwood, and building crude barriers with its sweeping, sawtooth tusks. To find oneself lost within the strange, meandering fences of the serrabrus is to incite the rage of the builder. |
| 66–70 | Night Weaver | Formidable | These enormous spiders have a sleek, obsidian exoskeleton and slender legs tipped with razor-sharp hooks. They lurk in shadowy places—such as grounded shipwrecks, deep caves, and dense woodlands—building elaborate webs as traps for unwary prey. |
| 71–75 | Sylvan Strider | Extreme | This gargantuan, insect-like creature moves through woodlands on multi-jointed legs the size of tree trunks. It often stands perfectly still while lying in wait for prey, indiscernible from the surrounding wilds. |
| 76–80 | Mimic Serpent | Extreme | The scales of this massive, canopy-dwelling snake can shift in hue and texture, allowing it to blend invisibly within its surroundings. After grasping its unaware prey, the mimic serpent coils around its victim, stealing air and crushing bones. |
| 81–85 | Ghost Rat | Dangerous | These pale rats of unusual size are accustomed to life within lightless caves. Ghost rats are blind, and use their keen sense of smell to navigate the depths. They pursue potential meals with hound-like persistence. |
| 86–90 | Gangle | Formidable | This large, cave-dwelling insect contorts its long limbs with uncanny flexibility—the joints cracking like breaking bones—to navigate the smallest crevices. These limbs, equipped with delicate sensory organs, enable the creature to perceive the subtlest vibrations and detect prey or threats from afar. After unfolding itself from its hiding place, the gangle attacks with a spray of burning saliva. |
| 91–95 | Deep Dragon | Epic | These ancient dragons lair in volcanic chambers, hibernating for centuries amid superheated steam and gases. They are flightless, with only vestigial wings, but their titanic scale and molten breath mark them as the greatest of dragon-kind. The rare emergence of a deep dragon from its burrow is a catastrophic reckoning for the surface world. |
| 96–100 | Abomination | Various Ranks | Generate this beast using the _Starforged [[_SF_CH5_Creatures\|Creatures Oracle]] (page 336 of the _Starforged_ rulebook), giving it a land form. |

*61 BEASTS OF THE ISLES*

> ## BEASTS OF THE SHORE AND RIVER ^beasts-shore-river

| 1D100 | Name | Rank | Description |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–20 | Great Crocodile | Various Ranks | Large crocodiles dwell in waters throughout the isles, including coastal wetlands, rivers, and the depths of tidal caves. The greatest and fiercest of them are the size of a sloop—armed with dagger-like teeth, impenetrable hides, and powerful tails capable of shattering stone. |
| 21–35 | Tenebrous Squid | Extreme | This beast dwells within shoreline hollows and sea caves. It is a cunning and patient creature, slumbering for months or years until hapless prey wanders into its dark lair. As it awakens, its orb-like eyes glimmer with a foul, hungry light, and its barbed tentacles prepare to strike. |
| 36–50 | Diving Spider | Dangerous | These semi-aquatic arachnids trap air with their silk, enabling them to hunt along riverbeds and coastal shallows, or lurk along the shore in wait of prey. They occasionally get caught up in nets, an unlucky catch for fisher folk. |
| 51–65 | Muck Toad | Formidable | This creature lurks within the mire of swamps and muddy rivers. What the muck toad lacks in speed and agility, it makes up for in strength and scale, grasping prey with its prehensile tongue and swallowing it whole with its cavernous maw. |
| 66–75 | Sand Dragon | Formidable | Sand dragons are the smallest of dragon-kind, but are still a fearsome foe. Burrowing beneath shoreline dunes, it stirs at the telltale vibrations of footfalls upon its lair. It attacks with dagger-like claws, teeth as long and wicked as cutlasses, and breath of scalding steam. |
| 76–85 | Keelback Crab | Extreme | The keelback crab uses a scavenged ship as a protective shell for its soft exoskeleton. Reports of ghost ships can often be attributed to keelbacks, scuttling along coastal waters with wrecks on their backs. As it grows, a keelback must commandeer vessels of increasing size. |
| 86–95 | Jade Crab | Extreme | The jade crab is the largest and most aggressive of the crustaceans, able to snap a longboat or even a small ship in two with its vice-like pincers. At rest, their shell is slate gray, easily mistaken for rocks or reefs. On the hunt, they shimmer with an iridescent blue-green. Fiercely territorial, these creatures often claim a waterway, cove, or sea cave as their lair. |
| 96–100 | Abomination | Various Ranks | Generate this beast using the _Starforged_ [[_SF_CH5_Creatures\|Creatures Oracle]] (page 336 of the _Starforged_ rulebook), giving it a land or water form. |

*62 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES*

> ## BEASTS OF THE SKY ^beasts-sky

| 1D100 | Name | Rank | Description |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–20 | Great Hawk | Various Ranks | Various types of enormous hawks hunt among the isles, including the mangrove-dwelling ash hawk and the coastal wind reaver. The greatest of them, the fabled vastwing, is said to be capable of grasping and lifting a fully loaded longboat in its enormous talons. |
| 21–35 | Iron Dragon | Extreme | The most common dragon of the isles, the iron dragon dwells in a variety of environments, from rocky coasts to deep inland jungles. They have a tough hide the color of weathered iron, dreadful claws, and a long, powerful tail. But their most potent weapon is their fiery breath, the bane of any wooden ship that earns their ire. Some island folk revere these creatures. But others harness them and ride into battle, launching from a seaside fort or a ship’s deck to lay waste to their enemies. |
| 36–50 | Wave Skimmer | Formidable | These winged reptilian beasts nest along waterside cliffs, and are adept at diving to spear fish with barbed beaks. Fishing boats and cargo ships often fall prey to wave skimmer ambushes, as the cunning predators have learned of the great bounties hidden within those vessels. |
| 51–65 | Goregull | Dangerous | Scavengers by nature, the vulture-sized goregulls feed primarily on dead sea life, but are known to harass the crews of floundering ships. |
| 66–75 | Monarch Bat | Formidable | These oversized bats, large enough to carry off an unlucky islander, dwell in caves and amid jungle canopies. As the sun sets, they leave their roosts to hunt. They are particularly dangerous on moonless nights when their swift, silent approach goes unnoticed. |
| 76–85 | Bloodmite | Dangerous | Bloodmites are hound-sized, flying insects. They primarily cling to the hide of titanic beasts, feeding through a blade-tipped proboscis, but are not averse to preying upon smaller targets. |
| 86–95 | Thanatoi | Dangerous | These moth-like creatures are unsettlingly large but harmless. They are often seen on nights when Wraith is full—they shimmer with a strange, ethereal glow, as if reflecting the light of the moon. Many islanders believe they escort souls into the world beyond. Look too long into their alluring glow, they say, and you suffer a glimpse of your own death. |
| 96–100 | Abomination | Various Ranks | Generate this beast using the _Starforged_ [[_SF_CH5_Creatures\|Creatures Oracle]] (page 336 of the _Starforged_ rulebook), giving it an air form. |
