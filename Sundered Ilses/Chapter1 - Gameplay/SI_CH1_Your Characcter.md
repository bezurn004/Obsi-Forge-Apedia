# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Your Character
When you play within the world of the _Sundered Isles_, you explore the stories of resolute seafaring characters who set off in pursuit of their sworn vows. _Sundered Isles_ offers an array of new character options, resources, and tips to help envision your perilous exploits beyond the far horizon.

## CHARACTER PILLARS
When you create your character in the [[SI_CH2_Create Your Character|campaign launch exercise]] (page 90), you envision your background. Are you a native of the isles? A refugee from faraway lands? An imperial deserter or insurgent? Whatever your backstory, there are three baseline assumptions.

> ## YOU ARE IRONSWORN
> By tradition, honorbound folk of the isles bind their promises and ambitions to iron vows. These vows are at the heart of your adventures, a lodestar that guides your course. What will you sacrifice, what hardships will you endure, to see them fulfilled?

> ## YOU ARE A SEAFARER
> You might be a skilled, novice, or reluctant mariner, but your fate lies among the winds and tide. When you launch your campaign, you can start with your own ship to command, serve under the command of an ally or NPC, or begin your story on the path to earn—or seize—a ship of your own.

> ## YOU ARE A REBEL
> You might be a pirate, an insurgent, or a spy. Or perhaps you simply forge your own path outside the reach of authoritarian powers. No matter your initial circumstances and goals, the clash between freedom and oppression will eventually sweep you up like a surging tide. You find no peace or compromise in the face of tyranny.

Your _Sundered Isles_ character uses the standard _Starforged_ stat array, momentum meter, and condition meters. There is one exception: if you command a ship, its hold serves as an extra supply meter for you and your allies. Learn more about the [[SI_CH1_Supply at Sea|ship's hold]] on page 26. Download the print-and-play _Sundered Isles Playkit_ and asset cards at ironswornrpg.com—or check your favorite virtual tabletop (VTT) application for _Sundered Isles_ content and compatibility.

## CHARACTER ASSETS
There are dozens of new options for your _Sundered Isles_ characters. This includes:
- Your command vehicle, a [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]]
- Modules to upgrade and customize your ship, such as an [[AST_Armored Prow|ARMORED PROW]], [[AST_Lucky Figurehead|LUCKY FIGUREHEAD]], and [[AST_Improved Hold|IMPROVED HOLD]]
- Support Vehicles, including a [[AST_Longboat|LONGBOAT]] and [[AST_Diving Bell|DIVING BELL]]
- A variety of character paths for the fantasy seafaring setting, such as [[AST_Duelist|DUELIST]], [[AST_Musketeer|MUSKETEER]], [[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]], and [[AST_Swashbuckler|SWASHBUCKLER]]
- Helpful animal companions, including a [[AST_Jungle Cat|JUNGLE CAT]] and [[AST_Parrot|PARROT]], along with more wondrous companions such as a [[AST_Dragon|DRAGON]] and [[AST_The Kraken|THE KRAKEN]]
- Deeds to mark the evolution of your character’s legacy and nature among the isles, such as [[AST_Fleet Commander|FLEET COMMANDER]] and [[AST_Undead|UNDEAD]]

Several of these assets represent your potential role as a ship commander. Learn more about [[SI_CH1_Your Ship|ship and module assets]] on page 16, and explore assets for [[SI_CH1_Command and Crews|command and crews]] on page 22.

### BUILDING YOUR ASSET DECK
Your complete _Sundered Isles_ asset deck includes new assets and a selection of core _Starforged_ assets. During the character  creation exercise, you customize which assets are available to you and your allies. For example, you might omit supernatural powers if magic is not a reality in your world.

The curated deck is a recommendation, not a mandate. Adjust as you like. Be mindful of potential overlap between assets, and work to ensure that you and your allies can rely on distinct resources, abilities, and roles.

*11 YOUR CHARACTER*

> ## WHO WILL YOU BE?
> When you create your character in the [[SI_CH2_Create Your Character|campaign launch exercises]] (page 90), you select two path assets as the foundation of your character concept. When you start that exercise, use the [[SI_CH1_Your Characcter#Asset Guide|asset guide]] on pages 14–15 to assemble your _Sundered Isles_ asset deck.

### ASSEMBLING YOUR ASSET DECK
Recommended assets shown here include a curated mix of assets drawn from _Starforged_ without content changes (2), and new options for the fantasy seafaring setting (1).

Some assets use supernatural or mythic powers (4) or remarkable technologies (5). If your setting is grounded in a more historical or gritty tone, you might prefer to omit these assets from your deck.

Many assets (3) are suitable for both the seafaring setting of _Sundered Isles_ and the default sci-fi setting of _Starforged._ If you’re ready to take on the perils of the Forge as a daring [[AST_Swashbuckler|SWASHBUCKLER]] or robotic [[AST_Construct|CONSTRUCT]], you’re all set. You can also use assets such as [[AST_Crew Member|CREW MEMBER]] and [[AST_Cohort|COHORT]] to help depict the crew of a spacefaring vessel.

Print-and-play versions of asset cards are available at ironswornrpg.com. Preprinted _Starforged_ and _Sundered Isles_ asset decks are also available for purchase.

> **MIXING AND MATCHING**
> If you use other _Starforged_ assets (not listed here), be mindful of doubling up on roles or abilities. Some _Sundered Isles_ assets are reimagined and renamed versions of Starforged counterparts. For example, [[AST_Peddler|PEDDLER]] replaces the _Starforged_ [[AST_Trader|TRADER]]. The surest course is to use the _Sundered Isles_ curated deck, but if you find a better fit for your character or setting elsewhere, you are free to customize.

> **THE RULE OF 3**
> Assets are inherently flexible and “stackable.” This means you might encounter asset combinations that make success a foregone conclusion for a specific action. On one hand, it’s satisfying to be successful. You’ve worked hard to acquire your assets, and it’s time to reap the benefits. On the other, frequent success can drain the tension and drama out of your story, and tallying bonuses can take up valuable play time. Plus, hyper-specialization offers diminishing returns—both narratively and mechanically.
> 
> To keep your _Sundered Isles_ adventures on a knife-edge of danger and unpredictability, apply these three simple guidelines:
> 1. Use abilities from no more than 3 assets in a single action, and select those assets before rolling.
> 2. Take no more than +3 adds in total from assets on a roll.
> 3. If these rules negatively affect the fun or excitement of your adventures, ignore them.
