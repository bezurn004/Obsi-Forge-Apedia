# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Navigating the Isles
Perilous journeys within the isles–whether by sea or overland–are managed through [[_SI_CH4_Exploration Moves|exploration moves]] (page 242). Below are some setting assumptions to help add flavor and context to those moves. [[_SF_CH3_Exploration Moves|See page 168]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook for additional guidance on travel and exploration.

## TRAVELING BY SEA
When sailing among the isles, you don’t simply unfurl the sails and set a constant heading to your destination. A voyage of twenty leagues as the gull flies is likely twice that distance along a meandering route. Abundant tiny islets, often uncharted, stand in your path. The push and pull of the two moons cause severe, erratic tides, and hull-breaching rocks and reefs lurk in shallow waters. The wind and weather can change in minutes. A sail sighted on the horizon might be friend or foe.

Within the Myriads, routes with reliably deep water and charted obstacles allow for predictable passages from one port to another–although those routes can change with the vagaries of time and tide. In the Margins and Reaches, reliable passages are often unmapped or known only to a few.

When preparing to set sail, consider the context of these setting assumptions and the nature of your voyage. Have you traveled this route before? Do you have charts or another character to guide you? What are the potential dangers?
- **If your destination is a short distance across safe waters**, don’t make a move.
- **If you know the way, but the voyage entails uncertainty or risk**, [[SI_CH4_Set a Course#Set a Course Move Card|Set a Course (SI Moves)]] to see what happens with a single roll.
- **If you must find your way across perilous waters**, set a rank for the voyage and roll to [[SI_CH4_Undertake an Expedition#Undertake an Expedition Move Card|Undertake an Expedition (SI Moves)]] for each segment of travel. When your destination is in sight, [[SI_CH4_Finish an Expedition#Finish an Expedition Move Card|Finish an Expedition (SI Moves)]].

### CROSSING THE BOUNDS
[Each region (page 8)] is separated from the next by a stretch of deep, open water. ==The Lesser Bounds== separate the Myriads from the Margins, and the ==Greater Bounds== are between the Margins and the Reaches.

Without the aid of landmarks, mariners crossing either of the Bounds must rely on navigational skills and careful tacking for winds and currents. Perhaps most critical is the state of the ship’s hold, since you’ll be days or even weeks at sea without an opportunity to resupply.

Resolve a crossing using the [[SI_CH4_Set a Course#Set a Course Move Card|Set a Course (SI Moves)]]. Envision the journey, the dizzying open horizon, the long wait for the appearance of land in the distance. If you roll a miss, per the move’s outcome, “you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must [[SI_CH4_Pay the Price#Pay the Price Move Card|Pay the Price (SI Moves)]].” Envision what happens and what you do to overcome the obstacle.

If the Bounds is part of a longer journey, bookend the crossing with expeditions. Set your destination for the first expedition to the edge of the Bounds, or to a port that serves as a last stop. Then [[SI_CH4_Set a Course#Set a Course Move Card|Set a Course (SI Moves)]] for the crossing. Begin the next expedition as you reach the other side of the Bounds and arrive in the new region.

## TRAVELING BY LAND
Whether you’re gathering provisions, following the breadcrumbs of a quest, or simply making your way from point A to point B, your adventures will eventually send you on an overland journey.

As with a seagoing voyage, you have options for resolving overland travel. Consider the situation and the amount of focus you want to give this aspect of your adventure. Are you setting off along a well-trod road connecting two settlements? No move is necessary unless you’re facing a danger or complication. Are you heading upriver on a risky journey to a known inland settlement? Set a Course. Are you striking out into unfamiliar wilderness on a remote island? That’s a perfect excuse to give this adventure some focus as you [[SI_CH4_Undertake an Expedition#Undertake an Expedition Move Card|Undertake an Expedition (SI Moves)]] 

If you’re not sure, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]]. The [[_SI_CH3_Island Oracles|Island (SI Oracles)]] (page 142) can help as you envision the size, landscape, and habitation of an island.

## CHARTING YOUR COURSE
Some seafarers rely on memory and intuition. Others keep detailed logs and cryptic charts replete with headings, soundings, tidal readings, landmarks, and hazards. Like those mariners, you choose how to chronicle your adventures. Want to immerse yourself? Create an in-character ship’s log and detailed maps. Would you rather focus on the moment-to-moment story? Just keep a few hasty notes. There’s no wrong answer. If you’re having fun and the info you need is at-hand, you’re doing it right.

If you want to chart your travels, a suggestion: the seas are vast, and it helps to zoom in and focus by creating a navigation chart for a section of local seas and islands. These charts serve as a record of your adventures and discoveries among the isles, and help frame the complexity and danger of your journeys—whether you are sailing known or unknown waters.

Much like a sector map in _Starforged_, a navigation chart offers a manageable scope, and can be as abstract as you like. For quickly-rendered maps, use circles or roughly sketched outlines for islands and simple notations for other features.

> #incomplete Add art or diagram of Islands and points of interests
> Sharktooth Islets - Sentinel Rock - Wreck of the Jade Empress - Stormcliff - Glimmerport - Carina Cay - Auki Isles - Amara Keya

You’ll find a navigation chart worksheet as part of the _Sundered Isles Playkit_. It includes a space to draw your map, along with a ==[[SI_CH1_Factions of the Isles#FACTION INFLUENCE GRID|faction influence grid]]== (page 50).

We’ll sketch out the beginnings of your first chart as you get your campaign underway in the _[[_SI_CH2_Contents|next  chapter]]_ (page 64). When you decide you’ve traveled beyond the boundaries of an area, it’s time for a fresh chart. As appropriate to your character’s familiarity with the area or access to existing charts, you might generate a few features to put on your chart as you sail into a new area, or find your way on a blank map. If you want inspiration for naming a local area within the isles, check the [[SI_CH3_Misc_Travel|Local Seas (SI Oracles)]] on page 227.

## EXPEDITION WAYPOINTS
The nature of travel within the isles lends itself to the cadence of _Starforged_ expedition moves, with each segment of a journey separated by a ==waypoint==. A waypoint is not necessarily a location. It can spotlight an event, encounter, or simply a moment of character interaction or introspection. At sea, you can envision finding safe anchorage to wait out weather and tide, creating an opportunity for a waypoint as a roleplaying ==[[SI_CH1_Interludes|interlude]]== (page 46). On land, you and your fellow travelers take a break or make camp as appropriate.

Use the _[[SI_CH3_Seafaring Waypoints|Seafaring Waypoints]]_ table (page 120) to inspire situations and locations at sea. For an island expedition, look to _[[SI_CH3_Overland Waypoints|Overland Waypoints]]_ (page 148).

An important note: Roll for a waypoint only when you are inspired to inject uncertainty, danger, strangeness, or narrative potential into your story. Otherwise, simply envision the waypoint as appropriate to the current situation and the outcome of your move.

## VISITING SETTLEMENTS
A ==settlement== is an island community—a village, town, or city. Some settlements have endured the test of time, standing as  testaments to their peoples’ long history. Others are newly-founded, a footprint upon an uninhabited, forsaken, or occupied island. And some are captured as spoils of war, subjugated by enemies and empires. They range from small villages, to bustling port towns, to sprawling city-states.

Visiting a settlement might serve as a critical step in your pursuit of a quest, an opportunity to rest and refit through the [[SI_CH4_Sojourn#Sojourn Move Card|Sojourn (SI Moves)]], or an excuse to enjoy some low-key interactions with local folk. The _[[_SI_CH3_Island Oracles|Island (SI Oracles)]]_ (page 142) and _[[SI_CH3_Overland Waypoints#Oracle Overland Waypoint|Overland Waypoints (SI Oracles)]]_ table (page 148) can reveal settlements as expedition waypoints.

To envision the look and nature of a settlement, use the _[[_SI_CH3_Settlement Oracles|Settlement (SI Oracles)]]_ (page 164). These details can drive opportunities, complications, and quests in your story.
