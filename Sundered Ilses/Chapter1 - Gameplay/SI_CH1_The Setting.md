# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: The Setting
Your adventures are set within the ==Sundered Isles==. This is a vast realm of scattered islands and islets within equatorial seas. It is a long voyage to the isles from a continental domain on the other side of the world.

It is an age of sail. Mighty ships conduct exploration, transport, trade, and war. Your own ship is an essential aspect of your character and their quest-driven exploits.

## FEATURES OF THE ISLES
In the campaign launch exercises starting on page 66, you decide the truths of your island realm. To start, here are some default touchstones.

### UNCOUNTABLE ISLANDS
Thousands upon thousands of islands are spread out across these seas. Many are lush, holding their mysteries within the shadows of jungles or amid the tangle of swamps. Some sit within rain shadows or lie at the mercy of prevailing winds that leave them barren. Others are scarred by storms, volcanic forces, or the ravages of despoilers.

### DIVERSE PEOPLE
Many isles are inhabited. Some folk have lived among them for ages, while others are refugees cast upon the shores like flotsam from distant lands. And some are opportunists or agents of continental empires who seek to exploit the Sundered Isles for power or riches.

### PERILOUS SEAS
Sailing among the isles presents many risks. Mariners face unpredictable storms and dramatic tides. Rocky islets, numerous as stars in the sky, force careful maneuvering. Catching sight of another ship’s sails is not always welcome, as foes often outnumber friends in these waters. Some even tell of seagoing beasts and dreaded ghost ships.

Despite these dangers, many follow a time-honored seafaring tradition. To them, the sea is not forbidding or mysterious; it is as much a home as their island settlements.

### MIGHTY SHIPS
You and other seafarers navigate the isles in sailing ships. These vessels, often bristling with cannons, are the pinnacle of the shipwright’s craft. But even the greatest of ships is vulnerable. Commanders and crews must keep a weather eye for the threats that prowl these waters—be it marauders or monsters.

### CLASHING FACTIONS
The isles bear the scars of a long history of disaster and strife. Recently, conflicts have reached a fever pitch as opposing factions conduct campaigns of espionage and open warfare. Foremost is the struggle against the tyranny of imperial powers.

## THE MOONS AND THE TIDES
Two moons—==Cinder== and ==Wraith==—hang over the world of the Sundered Isles. Cinder is the red of cooling flames. Wraith is silver-blue. The intricate dance of the moons creates tides that vary dramatically by hour, day, and season. These tides are the rhythm of the isles, but it is a complex and discordant beat. Skilled mariners learn to anticipate and adapt to these forces. The unlucky and careless find themselves amid rocky shallows or struggling against fierce currents.

Islanders divine omens from which moon rises or sets first, or which is shining and which is shadowed, but seldom agree on the meanings of those signs. Some favor Cinder’s ruddy glow, while others prefer Wraith’s cold light. A few see cloudy and moonless nights as a blessing—a chance to escape Cinder and Wraith’s oppressive gaze—but many fear what lurks in the darkness.

### THE TWIN FATES
The people of the isles often refer to the moons as the Twin Fates. Want to give your playscape a thematic boost? Treat your challenge dice as manifestations of the Fates. Designate one D10 as Cinder, and the other as Wraith. Choose colors that evoke the
light of each moon.

When helpful, use these challenge dice to reveal the nature of a situation, either by adding nuance to a move result or as a standalone oracle. Let the higher of the two dice decide. Cinder is hot: aggressive, passionate, resolute, physical. Wraith is cool: careful, mysterious, cunning, unearthly. On a match, choose which has the most influence.

To learn which moon the sky favors on a particular night, roll both dice. A low value on a moon’s die means it is shadowed or not visible. A high roll has it hanging brightly in the sky. 10 means it is full. Double full moons is a rare event, full of portent.

## REGIONS OF THE ISLES
Even those who sail these seas have yet to learn their full extent. Charts, maps, logs, and ancestral knowledge form an elaborate jigsaw puzzle—and none possess all the pieces. Nevertheless, the folk of this realm divide the _Sundered Isles_ broadly into three regions: the Myriads, the Margins, and the Reaches.

> ### MYRIADS
> The weather is fair, often as not. Trade ships sail charted passages between bustling ports, while pirates, privateers, and wreckers hunt for easy prey.

> ### MARGINS
> Greater distances separate the islands and settlements. The weather is fickle. Ships and crews must rely on skill and good fortune when sailing these waters. 


> ### REACHES
> Here the weather and seas are most unpredictable, the isles and people most isolated, the mysteries and dangers most profound. But many crave the freedom of these far-flung seas.

Each region is separated from the next by wide stretches of fathomless, featureless sea—the ==Bounds==. Between the Myriads and Margins lies the ==Lesser Bounds==, while the ==Greater Bounds== separate the Margins and the Reaches. Traversing the Bounds is a rite of passage for young mariners.

## FORGING YOUR VERSION OF THE ISLES
Most of all, the Sundered Isles lie within a world of your own making. What is the state of technology? How significant is the threat of imperial powers? Is magic a force within this realm? Are great beasts myth or reality? Do cursed undead sail these waters? Use the guided exercises starting [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Chapter 2 - Getting Underway (SI)]] on page 64 to learn more about the isles and decide the cornerstones of the setting.

Then, through the course of the story, you reveal new aspects of the world. You may even face revelations or discover contradictions that force you to revisit your commonly-understood truths, such as encountering undead foes you previously thought to be a myth or discovering wondrous, seemingly impossible technology.

## EXPLORING A CURSED WORLD
Sundered Isles introduces a tool to influence the presence of supernatural forces and locations in your world: the cursed die. This die, rolled alongside your oracle dice for certain tables, reveals uncanny and unsettling events, grim discoveries, strange locations, confounding technologies, and monstrous foes.
