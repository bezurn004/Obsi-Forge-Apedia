# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Interludes
Need a break from the perils of the isles? An interlude is a low-stakes, character-focused downtime scene. It is a chance to deepen your character’s personality, interests, and background—or add detail to the people and places of your world. Some examples:
- Practice a trade or craft
- Take in an awe-inspiring view
- Join the crew in a raucous shanty
- Partake in a drinking contest
- Share a moment of intimacy
Interludes help vary the pace of your sessions. They give your story and character time to breathe outside the pressure of risky actions and costly outcomes.

## INTRODUCING AN INTERLUDE
Interludes are flexible, player-driven devices. When there is a break from immediate pressure or danger in your story, and you are interested in focusing on your character or their relationships within a relatively risk-free framing, make it happen.

When you [[SI_CH4_Undertake an Expedition#Undertake an Expedition Move Card|Undertake an Expedition (SI Moves)]], the occasional interlude can help with envisioning how your character spends their time while traveling or during a lull at a waypoint. An interlude is directly prompted as a result on the _[[SI_CH3_Seafaring Waypoints|Seafaring Waypoints]]_ (page 120) and _[[SI_CH3_Overland Waypoints|Overland Waypoints]]_ (page 148) tables, but you’re free to simply introduce an interlude instead of rolling for a sighting or event on those tables.

### ENVISIONING THE INTERLUDE
Playing out an interlude can involve a quick, handwaved summary, or an extended bit of roleplay. The details of the activity or event are up to you. Is there an interesting member of the crew you’d like to learn more about? Does your character have a hobby or interest? Is this an opportunity to revisit a lingering rivalry or dispute? If you want inspiration for the focus and nature of a scene, use the _[[SI_CH3_Misc_Travel|Interlude Scene ]]_ table (page 228). Pick or roll on this table as you like.

> ### STARTING YOUR SESSION WITH AN INTERLUDE
The [[SI_CH4_Begin a Session#Begin a Session Move Card|Begin a Session (SI Moves)]] offers an option to explore a vignette—such as a flashback scene—that can serve as a character interlude. But the suggested prompts in that move often involve aspects of your campaign that are outside your character’s perspective. More importantly, [[SI_CH4_Begin a Session#Begin a Session Move Card|Begin a Session (SI Moves)]] is not triggered in the midst of a session, making it less useful as a narrative pressure valve during play. Use [[SI_CH4_Begin a Session#Begin a Session Move Card|Begin a Session (SI Moves)]] to put wind in the sails of your story as you sit down to play, and character interludes to add texture to your character and their world.

## MAKING MOVES DURING INTERLUDES
Interludes are low-risk, low-stakes. You might trigger a move in the midst of an interlude scene—such as [[SI_CH4_Hearten#Hearten Move Card|Hearten (SI Moves)]] to boost your spirits in a moment of peace, [[SF_CH3_Compel|Compel (move)]] to defuse an argument among crewmembers, or [[SI_CH4_Secure an Advantage#Secure an Advantage Move Card|Secure an Advantage (SI Moves)]] to train or prepare—but the outcomes of those moves should reflect the low-key nature of the situation. If you have questions about an interaction or event, simply decide what happens or [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]]. If a situation is not dramatic or uncertain, don’t otherwise make a move.

Except in rare circumstances, perhaps a miss with a match, the outcome of a move during an interlude should not upend your quests, introduce dramatic new complications, or inflict harsh mechanical costs. Keep it low-key.

> [!cite]
> You envision an interlude as a sparring match between your character and another crewmember—a talented fencer. You can simply decide how you fare in the match, or you might focus not on the duel itself but on the flirtatious banter (an all-too-common byproduct of swordfights). But you’d like to add some minor risk and reward to the contest, so you frame it as an opportunity to improve your skills and Secure an Advantage to see what happens. On a hit, you take the momentum boost. On a miss, you suffer momentary embarrassment—and dedicate yourself to doing better the next time you cross swords.

> [!tip] ## INTERLUDES WITH ALLIES
> Anyone at the table can suggest an interlude. When playing with allies, you can explore the relationships among your troupe of characters, or give focus to a specific character in key moments. Be mindful of rotating the spotlight. When initiating or playing out an interlude, check-in to ensure everyone is interested and invested in a scene. Adjust the pace—drawing out the scene or moving to wrap things up—as appropriate. Take a Break if needed, and use the transition to discuss what happens next.
