# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH1_Contents|Gameplay]]: Factions of the Isles
You are not alone among the isles. Factions of all sorts go about their business in the background of your world. But the factions with the most focus are those that intersect with your character’s story. Which patrons task you with missions? Who do you count among your allies? Who are you sworn to resist? Use factions to reinforce the imagined reality of your setting, while focusing on those that generate opportunities and conflict in your story.

## REVEALING FACTIONS
As part of the campaign launch exercises in the next section, you introduce a handful of factions and define how they relate to each other and your character. Then, through the course of your story, new factions may emerge.

When adding a faction or exploring the details of an existing faction, trust your narrative instincts. Look to the foundations of your imagined setting and inspiration from other media. Does it support the tones and themes you want to explore in your story? Does it add drama and conflict to your world? Does it connect to your character and other factions in interesting ways? If so, bring it to life.

If unsure about a specific detail of a faction, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]]. But keep it simple. Leave aspects and mysteries to uncover, operating mainly from the limited perspective and knowledge of your character. If you want inspiration for factions, this book includes some helpful tools:

- **Faction Oracles:** Generate the details of a faction using the [[_SI_CH3_Faction Oracles|oracle tables]] starting on page 176].
- **Sample Factions:** These faction summaries are organized in four categories: ==[[SI_CH3_Faction_Society|societies]]== (page 52), ==[[SI_CH3_Faction_Organization|organizations]]== (page 53), ==[[SI_CH3_Faction_Empire|empires]]== (page 54), and ==[[SI_CH3_Faction_The Cursed|the cursed]]== (page 55). Your campaign won’t include every faction from these lists—they are inspiration to pick, combine, or customize for your world. If you want to put things in the hands of fate when introducing a new faction, select a category and roll your oracle dice.

### CREATING FACTION NOTES
When introducing a faction, give it a name and a few details. Keep it simple, focusing on commonly understood aspects from your
character’s perspective. Also mark down any key personalities and connections within that faction. As new details arise in the course
of your story, add them to your existing notes.

> [!example] Akiya | SOCIETY
> - Alliance of island clans
> - Sails in sleek and speedy ships
> - Clans gather each year at the ebb of the storm season
> - Secretly aiding the Forsaken Fleet against the empire
>  
> Connection: Kova, a clan envoy

## THE FACES OF A FACTION
Factions are more relatable when you give them personalities to ground your interactions, conflicts, and quests. For example:
- A smuggler supplies weapons to an insurgency; they task you with missions to steal guns and powder from imperial ships
- A senior member of a mystic order seeks an apprentice; they train you in their sorcerous arts
- A pirate leads their band of marauders in search of a hidden treasure; you hold a piece of the map that leads to that lost fortune
- A necromancer is in command of an undead armada; you are sworn to defeat them

Not every interaction with a faction involves a recognized person, but you should look for opportunities to use factions to enrich your cast of characters. In particular, connections—those characters whose relationship evolves through the connection moves—are an ideal tether to whatever faction they represent.

> ### DIVERSITY WITHIN FACTIONS
> The people of the isles—even among a shared identity or culture—are diverse. Not every person within a faction wants the same thing or adopts the same cultural influences. Among imperial powers, there are insurgents. Among religious people, there are doubters. Among warring cultures, there are those who crave peace. Use factions to reveal the broad strokes of influential people and powers, while leaving nuances to be uncovered.

## FACTION PROJECTS
As you undertake your sworn vows, the factions of the isles seek to advance their own agendas. To depict and resolve the objectives and actions of factions in the background of your campaign, use campaign clocks. You can create campaign clocks for faction goals, and set competing factions against each other with opposing clocks.

Your character’s aid or opposition can influence whether a project stalls or succeeds. But some clocks run independently of your own exploits, a ticking inevitably that can alter the future of the isles—it’s only a matter of when. 

See page 235 in the _Starforged_ rulebook for details on running [[SF_CH3_Clocks_Campaign|campaign clocks]]. A campaign clock worksheet is included in the _Starforged Playkit._

## FACTION INFLUENCE GRID
The navigation chart worksheet, available in the _Sundered Isles Playkit_, includes a ==faction influence grid==. This tool can help manage the presence and control of factions in a local area.

When detailing or visiting a new area of the isles, consider the presence of known factions. Slot those factions into an appropriate field in the grid: dominant, established, subsisting, diminished, or obscure. The rankings represent the influence a faction wields and the potential frequency of encounters and interactions with representatives of that faction.

Leave a few fields blank. You may discover new factions or adjust a faction’s influence over time.


| DOMINANT 1–30 | ESTABLISHED 31–45 | ESTABLISHED 46–60 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hand of Theya | Forsaken Fleet |  |

| SUBSISTING 61–70 | SUBSISTING 71–80 | SUBSISTING 81–90 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Akiya Clans |  |  |

| DIMINISHED 91–94 | DIMINISHED 95–98 | OBSCURE 99–100 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acheron’s Armada |  |  |

### USING THE GRID
Each field has a range corresponding to a result on an oracle roll. When you encounter a ship or settlement, you can roll on the grid to randomly reveal its controlling faction. You can also use the matrix when you [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]] about a situation, such as “Which faction carried out the attack on the settlement?” If a roll lands on a blank field, choose the closest-ranked faction, or use this as a prompt to introduce an independent group or new faction to your world.

In addition, you can use the influence grid to track the ebb and flow of a faction’s power in an area. When a faction faces a major setback, reduce its rank. If it gains influence, raise the rank. You can even create a “global influence grid” to measure the power of key factions across the entirety of the isles.

## FACTION RELATIONSHIP MAPS
A ==relationship map== can help you visualize the ecosystem of people and powers in your world, and prevent important factions from getting lost in the shuffle.

To make your relationship map, use shapes, connectors, and simple notes to illustrate the connections between factions. Different colors or symbols can provide an at-a-glance representation of broad relationships, such as hostility versus cooperation. In the example below, negative relationships are in red.

Put your character in the relationship map as well (and your allies, if playing with others). If you have a connection to a faction, include a broad summary of that relationship from your character’s perspective.

Start simple, and leave plenty of space. You can return to the diagram to add details as the story and factions evolve.

> #incomplete Create Mermaid graph here
> [Akiya] < My kin [Me]
> [Forsaken Fleet (Pirates led by the Raven Queen)] < Stole my ship! [Me]
> [Hand of Theya (Evil Empire)] < Hate them [Me]
> [Hand of Theya (Evil Empire)] < Attacks and loots imperial ships & ports [Forsaken Fleet (Pirates led by the Raven Queen)]
> [Forsaken Fleet (Pirates led by the Raven Queen)] < Secretly helping the pirates [Akiya]

> Periodically update your faction notes, campaign clocks, influence grids, and relationship maps to keep track of evolving faction dynamics and revealed truths. If you enjoy managing these details, this is a good exercise to undertake as you [[SF_CH3_Begin a Session|Begin a Session (move)]]
> 
> Over time, some factions rise to the fore, others fade into the background, and new factions come onto the scene. This is part of creating an emerging narrative and focusing on what’s important and interesting.
> 
> However, these are tools to use or ignore as you like. If you aren’t interested in faction details or campaign-level machinations, feel free to keep factions in the background of your story.
