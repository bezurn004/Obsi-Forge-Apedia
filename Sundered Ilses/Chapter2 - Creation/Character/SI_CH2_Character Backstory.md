# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Creation]] - [[SI_CH2_Create Your Character|Character]]: Your Backstory
What is your backstory? What events or compelling need put you on a path of adventure? If you’re not sure, roll or choose on this table for inspiration.

This table uses an optional cursed die, as indicated by the skull icon: [skull]. This is an extra ten-sided die added to an oracle roll—one distinct from your oracle dice. If the cursed die rolls a 10, your answer is cursed—take the value of your oracle dice and check the cursed version of the table for your answer. The notation beside the cursed icon guides you to the location of that table. In this case, it’s on the next page. For details on [[SI_CH3_The Cursed Die|The Cursed Die]], see page 114.

> ## [skull] YOUR CURSED BACKSTORY
> Cursed backstories involve uncanny forces, monstrous foes, and strange technologies. If this isn’t appropriate for your setting, don’t roll the cursed die. If you want to emphasize those aspects of the world, feel free to roll directly on this table.
