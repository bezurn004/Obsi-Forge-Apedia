# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Create Your Character
What sent you on a path of peril and adventure? What role will you play among the isles? Let’s find out. Work through the character creation steps below. Adjust the order of these steps as you like.

> Allow about 20–30 minutes for this exercise.

Have your character sheet handy for this exercise. A printable sheet is included in the _Sundered Isles Playkit_ (available for download at ironswornrpg.com), or use your preferred digital app or virtual tabletop (VTT).

You also need your deck of asset cards, which includes a mix of original _Starforged_ assets and new _Sundered Isles_ assets. See the next page for details.

> ## CHARACTER CREATION WALK-THROUGH
### STEP 1: FORGE YOUR CHARACTER CONCEPT
Envision the broad strokes of your character concept. Who are you? What drives you? Keep in mind these pillars (see [[SI_CH1_Your Characcter#CHARACTER PILLARS|page 10 for details]]).
- ==You are Ironsworn==. What incident, need, or responsibility sends you on your quest-bound adventures?
- ==You are a seafarer==. What calls you or will send you to the sea? What skills or abilities set you apart?
- ==You are a rebel==. What faction, circumstance, or obligation do you resist? Who are your allies?

Need inspiration? Proceed to step 2 to generate foundational details of your character. If you’d rather lay the keel of your concept by picking path assets, go first to step 3.

### STEP 2: SEEK INSPIRATION
On [[SI_CH2_Character Backstory|pages 92-93]], you’ll find tables and prompts to flesh out your character with a backstory and characteristics. Use them to help envision your character. Make note of any interesting ideas or questions these tools evoke.

### STEP 3: CHOOSE TWO PATHS
Select two path assets from your _Sundered Isles_ deck ([[SI_CH1_Your Characcter#Asset Guide|pages 14-15]]). Choose assets that support an interesting character concept, reflect the nature of your world, and foster the stories that you and other players want to explore.

For guidance or inspiration, check the Persona tables on ([[SI_CH@_Characteristics and Persona|pages 94-95]]).

### YOUR SUNDERED ISLES ASSETS
As you begin this exercise, ready your deck using the outline and suggestions on ([[SI_CH1_Your Characcter#Asset Guide|pages 14-15]]).

During the exercise, you select two paths from that deck to form a basic character concept. For example, you might be a **[[AST_Scoundrel|SCOUNDREL]]** and **[[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]]**. Then, in the next exercise, you choose one  additional asset. Plus, if you begin your adventures in command of a seagoing vessel, you start with an undistinguished **[[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]]** or your **[[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]]** command vehicle.

> [!tip] ### BUILDING A TEAM WITH ALLIES
If you are working through this exercise with other players, take turns completing steps. Talk it through to create an interesting group with a reason to adventure together, but don’t get hung up on unnecessary details. Leave unanswered questions to figure out through the course of your story.

### STEP 4: NAME YOUR CHARACTER
Give your character a name. For inspiration, check the _[[SI_CH3_Character_Names|Names]]_ table on page 194]. If you are known by a moniker or title, note that as well. Then, mark down your character’s pronouns.

### STEP 5: WRITE YOUR BACKGROUND VOW
What ambition, need, or commitment drives you? This is your background vow. Mark the vow and give it an epic rank. If you’re not sure, save it for later—or look for inspiration on an oracle table such as _[[SI_CH3_Character_Drive#Oracle Character Goals|Character Goals]]_ (page 193).

To learn more about your background vow, see [[CRG_Background Vow|page 107]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook.

### STEP 6: SET YOUR STATS AND METERS
Set your stats by arranging these values across edge, heart, iron, shadow, and wits in any order: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1. To learn more about your stats, see the _Starforged_ rulebook  ([[CRG_Set Stats and Meters|page 110]]).

Next, set your condition meters and momentum to their starting values. Set your health, spirit, and supply to 5. Set your momentum to +2, your max momentum to +10, and your momentum reset to +2.

### STEP 7: PREPARE TO TAKE COMMAND
In the next exercise, you decide if you begin your adventures with a ship of your own to command, as well as the nature of your ship and crew. You also choose a final asset to complete your character. Go to page 96 to take command.
