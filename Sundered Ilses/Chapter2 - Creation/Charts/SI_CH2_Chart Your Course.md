# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign Creation]]: Chart Your Course
In this exercise, you’ll chart key locations in a local area, including a few islands and a seaside settlement. This is where your adventures begin.

> Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise.

Have ready the ==navigation chart worksheet== and ==connections worksheet== from the _Sundered Isles Playkit_. You’ll also want something to record notes for the locations, such as your journal or a stack of notecards. If you are playing using a digital tool or prefer another template, you need space for notes and a simple map.

> [!tip] Group Play
> If playing with others, one of you can read or summarize each step of this exercise. Everyone can participate in making decisions, rolling on oracle tables, and embellishing narrative hooks. Keep things moving, and don’t get hung up on details. You’ll discover more about these  locations and the people who live there through play.

### WHAT IS A NAVIGATION CHART?
A ==navigation chart== is a local map of islands and surrounding features. Your charts help track the progress of your journeys and discoveries within a manageable scope. Over time, you may create several charts as you move beyond the bounds of your starting area.

Learn more about navigation charts on [[SI_CH1_Navigating the Isles#CHARTING YOUR COURSE|page 34]].

### NAVIGATING THE ORACLES
During this exercise, you generate details for your starting location using several oracles. It might be helpful to bookmark those sections now to make it easier to move back and forth.
- [[_SI_CH3_Island Oracles|Island (SI Oracles)]] (page 142)
- [[_SI_CH3_Settlement Oracles|Settlement (SI Oracles)]] (page 164)
- [[_SI_CH3_Character Oracles|Character (SI Oracles)]] (page 186).

As you work through this exercise, roll or choose on the oracle tables as you like. Ignore or revise any details that don’t fit the established facts of your setting. 

### BUILDING OTHER REALMS
If you are sailing the skyfaring realm, this exercise helps generate a starting area with only minor reimagining. If you plan to adventure in the spacefaring realm, you should instead use the [[_CSG_Sector Creation Summary|Sector Creation Exercise]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook (page 114) to generate local planets and settlements.

> ### PREFER TO CUT AND RUN?
> If you want a more seat-of-the-pants start for your campaign, or already have an idea of a location you want to focus on, feel free to skip this exercise. This leaves the details to be discovered in play.
