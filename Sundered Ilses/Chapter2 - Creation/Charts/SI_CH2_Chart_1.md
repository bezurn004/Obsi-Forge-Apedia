# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[SI_CH2_Chart Your Course|Chart]]: Choose Your Starting Region
As detailed on page 8, the folk of the isles divide these seas broadly into three regions. Choose your starting region and note it on your navigation chart worksheet.

> ### MYRIADS
> These principal isles are widely settled. If you want to sail busy trade routes between bustling settlements, while keeping a weather eye for enemy sails, start here.

> ### MARGINS
> Greater distances separate the islands and settlements within this region. If you want to navigate less-traveled waters between remote places, start here.

> ### REACHES
> Here the islands and people are most scattered and isolated, the seas most unfamiliar. If you want to sail on stranger tides, start here.
