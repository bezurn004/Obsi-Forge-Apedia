# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[SI_CH2_Chart Your Course|Chart]]: Add a Local Connection
In this step, you add an important character as a connection to the local area. This person might be a patron for your character—someone of shared purpose who petitions or sponsors your initial adventures—or a helpful acquaintance. But keep in mind that connections are not shipmates or companions. They are independent characters whose own lives occasionally intersect with your own.

Answer these questions to create your local connection. If you are playing with others, this is a shared connection.
- **What is the connection’s role?** Decide their duty, expertise, or background. Their role offers a bonus when you make a move with their support—it should be general enough to be helpful, but specific enough to be flavorful. [[CSG_Create Local Connection#Give the Connection A Role|See Page 124]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook for tips on connection roles.
- **What is their rank?** The connection’s rank represents the challenge of advancing the relationship. The higher the rank, the greater the narrative focus and trouble involved to eventually [[SI_CH4_Forge a Bond#Forge a Bond Move Card|Forge a Bond (SI Moves)]] with them. Choose a rank appropriate to their role and the level of involvement you want them to have in your story: troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic.
- **What drives them?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Character_Drive#Oracle Character Goals|Character Goals]]_ table (page 193).
- **What is their name?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Character_Names#Oracle Character Name|Character Name]]_ table (page 194).
- **Are they linked to a faction?** Referencing your faction influence grid, decide if this connection has a relationship with a known faction.
- **Where are they found?** Choose a settlement or place on the map as the connection’s present location. If they are aboard a ship, note where it sails.
- 
Optionally, you can flesh out a connection with details using the questions below. If you’d prefer to keep it simple, wait until you interact with them to reveal more.

- **What are obvious characteristics of the connection?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Character_Approach|Character First Look]]_ table (page 186).
- **What item or gear is this person seldom without?** Roll or choose on _[[SI_CH3_Character_Trademarks#Oracle Trademark Accessory|Trademark Accessories]]_ (page 190) or _[[SI_CH3_Character_Trademarks#Oracle Trademark Weapon|Trademark Weapons]]_ (page 191).
- **What have I learned of this connection over time?** Roll or choose on the _[[SI_CH3_Character_Drive#Oracle Character Details|Character Details]]_ table (page 192)].

Record this person’s name, role, rank, and location on the connections worksheet, and add any interesting additional details to your journal or notes.

A reminder: Introducing this connection at the start of your campaign is essentially a “free” strong hit on the [[SI_CH4_Make a Connection#Make a Connection Move Card|Make a Connection (SI Moves)]].

> ### WANT MORE?
> If you envision your character having a more complete understanding of your starting area, repeat [[SI_CH2_Chart_4|step 4]] (page 103) to add another settlement or two. This may give you insight into relations among these settlements, but leaves less to uncover in the course of your story.
