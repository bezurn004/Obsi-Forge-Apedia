# PREPARE TO SET SAIL
In this section, you forge a character and your unique vision for the _Sundered Isles_ using a series of guided exercises. If you’re playing Sundered Isles with others, make this a group activity to give everyone a stake and input in the setting.

Remember: Prep is play. These exercises should be fun. If anything feels like work, skip it or take a shortcut and move on.

## CONSIDER THE TONE FOR YOUR WORLD
What sort of adventures do you want to undertake? Swashbuckling action? Treasure hunting? Scrappy, anti-imperial rebellions? Court espionage and intrigue? Spooky nautical exploration? Banishing eldritch horrors? Setting a baseline helps inform your choices in this section. If you’re playing with others, briefly talk it over.

If you’re unsure, the decisions you make in these exercises set your course. But don’t let the exercises undermine your own preferences. This section gives you a true north, but you are at the helm. Steer the ship as you like.

## BUILD A WORLD MINDFULLY
Depending on your choices in these exercises, your version of the Sundered Isles might feature aspects of the real-world age of sail. In popular media, this “age of discovery” is often romanticized. In reality, it was a time of brutal conquest, exploitation, and enslavement perpetrated by colonial powers. 

However, this is your world. You are encouraged to emphasize fun and adventure, but should do so in a way that doesn’t reinforce the harmful ideologies and stereotypes of our own history. Consider the following:

- **Prioritize diversity.** There are no setting assumptions that constrain your depiction of race, culture, disability, sexual  orientation, or gender identity. Envision a world of vibrant possibilities.
- **Reject the narratives used by colonizers to dehumanize indigenous people.** Do not depict any indigenous culture of the isles as monolithic in their values or as universally good or evil. Do not portray them as inherently primitive, strange, or magical compared to “default” identities.
- **Resist injustice.** If imperial forces have a role in your setting, they build their wealth, strength, and influence through exploitation and oppression. In their arrogance, they claim discovery and dominion over lands long-known and long-inhabited. Make no mistake—they are the enemy. Your character is not another cog in the colonial machine. You are meant to break the machine.
- **Carefully consider the representation of slavery in your campaign.** The slave trade was an abhorrent reality of the colonial age, but is not assumed to be an aspect of the _Sundered Isles_. For you or another player, any depiction of slavery may be harmful or unwanted content. Discuss this in the context of your worldbuilding and [[4 - Moves#SET A FLAG|Set a Flag]] as needed. If slavery is a reality in your setting, do not trivialize or romanticize it.
- 
*66 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## SUPPORT PLAYER SAFETY
As you work through the campaign launch exercises and anytime during play, use the [[4 - Moves#SET A FLAG|Set a Flag]] to identify content boundaries and to prioritize player safety, comfort, and fun over the narrative. This can include content that will be omitted, modified, or addressed on a case-by-case basis if it is encountered in your game.

Work with other players to ensure a collaborative environment where everyone can [[4 - Moves#SET A FLAG|Set a Flag]]. But keep in mind that using this move should not force a discussion of a content boundary. Players do not need to provide details or justification. If that is their wish, note the flagged content and move on.

![[4 - Moves#SET A FLAG]]

### USING OTHER SAFETY TOOLS
You might find that the Starforged session moves don’t fit the needs of your table. Each person is unique in what safety tools work for them, and many other safety tools address this variety of needs.

You can explore resources like the TTRPG Safety Toolkit to find safety tools that work best for you and your game. The TTRPG Safety Toolkit, curated by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk, is a compilation of safety tools designed by members of the tabletop roleplaying game community. You can find it here: bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit.

> ## WANT A QUICK START? 
> If you already have some idea of the setting, tone, and starting situations for your campaign, or if you are returning to an existing world, you can skip most of these exercises. Instead, do only the following:
> 
> - Create your character using the exercise [[#CREATE YOUR CHARACTER|starting on page 90]].
> - Choose your command using the exercise [[#CHOOSE YOUR COMMAND|starting on page 96]].
> - Play! You can sort out the rest through the course of your story.
> 
> Otherwise, if you are starting with a clean slate and want to set the stage for your adventures, turn to the next page to get started.

A word of warning: You might find your creative batteries running low if you pack the exercises into a single session. Consider breaking them into two or three sessions—whatever works for your group.

*68 GETTING UNDERWAY*

# SELECT YOUR REALM
In this first exercise, you set the stage for your adventures by choosing a realm. Will you sail a perilous sea, navigate the lofty heights of a storm-wracked sky, or cruise among the stars?

> #missingArt Allow about 5–10 minutes for this exercise.

The Seafaring Realm is the default. The setting truths, oracles, and character assets included with this supplement assume you are undertaking nautical adventures.

However, much of this is narrative texture that can be reenvisioned to better fit your preferred realm. “Sea” becomes a colloquial term to describe airborne or starborne passages. “Islands” are floating remnants of a shattered continent—or entire planets. You can focus on using the abstract, interpretative oracles instead of those that are more specific to the default setting. No matter your choice, you undertake adventures of sail and saber in a perilous age.

In short, for the most out-of-the-box _Sundered Isles_ experience, choose the Seafaring Realm. If you are willing to make a creative leap of faith or have a specific setting in mind, the _Starforged_ system is flexible enough to accommodate other adventures.

Check the following pages for details on the realms. Scan or read those entries as you like to learn more about their features and default assumptions. Once you make your choice, continue to the [[#CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS|next exercise on page 76]].

> [!summary] ### [[#THE SEAFARING REALM|SEAFARING REALM]] | \page 70
> The Sundered Isles lie within vast and perilous seas. 

> [!progress] ### [[#THE SKYFARING REALM|SKYFARING REALM]] | page 72

> The Sundered Isles are untold worlds adrift on aetherial tides.  

*69 SELECT YOUR REALM* 

## THE SEAFARING REALM 
<font size =3>In this realm, the _Sundered Isles_ lie within vast and perilous seas.</font>

No one knows the true extent of the isles. Untold numbers of them are scattered like broken shards across these equatorial waters.

The isles are home to a diverse array of people, societies, and cultures. Some trace their lineage to the mariners who first sailed these waters in ages past; they mark their history not in the passage of years, but through the ebb and flow of the tides and the communal memories of the generations who came before. Others settled here in recent years as refugees or outcasts from distant lands. And some seek only to exploit the resources and people of the isles for their own ends.

Seafarers who chart a course through the isles face unpredictable storms, fierce currents, shifting tides, shallow waters, and lurking marauders. For those who abide and understand the whims of the sea, this realm is home. Those who seek to control the sea, to gain mastery of it, find only a watery grave.

> [!summary] ### FEATURES
> - Mist-shrouded islands
> - Warm, turquoise seas
> - Rocky shoals, shallow reefs, and rugged islets
> - Coastal boats and mighty seagoing ships
> - Bustling ports and inland villages
> - Fast-moving storms
> - Stirrings of great beasts within shadowy depths
> - Ruins nestled in jungles, standing amid high rocks, and sunk beneath the sea
> - Skeletal frames of wrecked ships, cast against rock and reef

> This is the default when playing _Sundered Isles_. The oracles, new character assets, and other materials in this book are designed for this realm—but are often flexible enough to accommodate the other realms. Depending on the truths you select in the next exercise, your world can mirror our real-world age of sail, or spotlight more fantastical elements such as supernatural beings, steampunk-style technologies, and monstrous beasts. Your campaign might feature swashbuckling adventure, grim horror, desperate struggles against oppressive empires—or all the above! Ready to set sail with the wind in your hair and a vow in your heart? Chart a course for the seafaring realm.

*70 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## THE SKYFARING REALM
<font size=3>In this realm, the _Sundered Isles_ are the lofty fragments of a ruined continent.</font>

In a time before memory, a massive continent broke apart in an earth-shattering cataclysm. The remnants of this land were cast into the skies, held aloft by unknowable forces.

Eons later, the floating isles beckoned with mysteries and an escape from earthbound war and strife, so explorers crafted airships and launched them into the storm-wracked skies. Over time, people and nations founded burgeoning ports among the aerial enclaves, but much remains unknown and uncharted. The islands are in near-constant motion within a vortex of wind and uncanny gravitational anomalies, making navigation difficult and unpredictable.

Island ecosystems vary by altitude. In the lower regions, rain-soaked islands are covered by impenetrable jungle. Higher, temperate forests and rocky plateaus are shrouded in cold mist. Still higher, some say, icebound islands are locked in an endless winter.

> [!progress] ### FEATURES
> - Airborne islands capped by clinging vegetation
> - Waterfalls fall from broad cliffsides
> - Constant winds and passing rains
> - Flocks of birds swirl through misty skies
> - Storm clouds unleash lighting strikes and blasts of thunder
> - Villages and ports nestled among rocky enclaves
> - Ships tethered to portside docks
> - Colliding islands scatter smaller fragments

> When exploring the skyfaring realm, you interpret oracles and outcomes to fit the setting. For example, when generating a location using the Island Oracles, envision the results as the floating shard of a lost continent. In exchange for this leap of faith, this realm offers interesting possibilities for storytelling. What do settlements look like? What resources do the people trade? How are naval battles undertaken in three dimensions? Ready to soar through the skies and battle marauders in the dark heart of a thundercloud? Launch your ship into the skyfaring realm.

*72 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## THE STARFARING REALM
<font size=3>In this realm, the Sundered Isles are untold worlds adrift on aetherial tides.</font>

The people of your homeworld once navigated the oceans, but now they sail a limitless new frontier. Mighty ships harness aetherial currents and leave shimmering waves of prismatic energy in their wake. An untold number of worlds—colloquially called Isles by your once-seafaring people—spin in their complex orbits within this starry expanse.

For bold sailors who set off into this realm, the aether is life. Its starborne currents bear ships and provide breathable air in an otherwise deadly void. But the aether is capricious and ever-changing; navigating its chaotic passages demands skill, courage, and luck in equal measure.

> [!cite] ### FEATURES
> - Life-giving starborne currents
> - Colorful clouds of cosmic dust
> - Countless planets and planetoids orbiting shimmering stars
> - Aether ships gathering at bustling space ports
> - Unpredictable aether storms, vibrant with tumultuous energies
> - Strange creatures cruising in the wake of starborne vessels
> - Hulks of derelict ships, forever adrift
> - Mysterious vaults of alien civilizations

> The starfaring realm provides the greatest opportunity to freely mix-and-match your _Starforged_ and _Sundered Isles_ assets and oracles. Within this realm, you set a course for distant planets, navigate perilous asteroids fields, encounter extraordinary alien creatures—perhaps even delve ancient precursor vaults. As appropriate to the truths you select in the next exercise, your version of the setting might use technological _Starforged_ assets re-themed as aether-powered technologies.
> 
> Ready to wade into battle in your ironclad exosuit armed with a blade of scintillating energy? The starfaring realm awaits.

# CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS
In this exercise, you set the tone and background for your campaign by deciding the nature of your version of the Sundered Isles. These are your truths. When you’re done, you’ll have key aspects of your setting sketched out, and a backdrop of challenges to help fuel your adventures.
> #missingArt Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise.

## THE TRUTH CATEGORIES
This section includes 11 categories to help envision your version of the _Sundered Isles_. The categories are:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sundering | [[#SUNDERING\|Page 77]] | Piracy | [[#PIRACY\|Page 83]] |
| Relics | [[#RELICS\|Page 78]] | Religion | [[#RELIGION\|Page 84]] |
| Modern Era | [[#MODERN ERA\|Page 79]] | Magic | [[#MAGIC\|Page 85]] |
| Iron Vows | [[#Iron Vows\|Page 80]] | Beasts | [[#BEASTS\|age 86]] |
| Navigation | [[#NAVIGATION\|Page 81]] | Horrors | [[#HORRORS\|Page 87]] |
| Empires | [[#EMPIRES\|Page 82]] |  |  |

To keep things moving, read the bold text in each category as a rundown of your options. Use or ignore the expanded summaries and quest starters as you like. For more tips on choosing your truths, [[CTR_Choose Your Truths#Tips For Managing This Exercise|see page 83]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook.

Each category also includes suggestions for character assets, marked with a person (![[character.svg|15]]) icon, and potential factions to add to the setting, marked with a flag (![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]]) icon. If a recommended asset interests you, or a faction fits your vision for the world, make note of it. In the following two exercises, you introduce factions to the isles and choose your character assets.

## HOW TO SELECT YOUR TRUTHS
Select your truth for each category in one of three ways. Mix and match these techniques as you like..

## SUNDERING
How did the isles earn their name?

---

|  |  |
| :---: | --- |
| 1–33 | **A great war left horrible scars upon the isles.** |
|  | A generations-old war is only recently ended, and the reminders of that fruitless conflict are all around us. Islands wracked by destruction, seas tainted, people displaced. The cost is immeasurable, but some still squabble over what remains. |
 
>Quest Starter: A people, displaced by war, live on a remote island. A recent illness left many sick or dead. Supplies are urgently needed. Why do you swear to give them aid? Who stands against you, and why?
---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **Eons ago, a vast cataclysm shattered continents.** |
|  | Lands broke apart in an apocalyptic disaster. Powerful cities fell. Fire, lava, and ash scoured what remained. The isles, scattered like broken shards, are the vestiges of these once-great lands, the gravestones of a fallen dominion. Life eventually returned to this realm, but the wounds do not fully heal. |

> Quest Starter: You are haunted by dreams of this ancient cataclysm. In those dreams, you see a grand library of unfathomable scope, the collected knowledge of lost people and fallen dominions. What do you seek within this repository?
---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **Strange technologies unleashed a reality-fracturing wave of cursed energy, forever reshaping the isles.** |
|  | An ambitious few dabbled in ancient secrets, and in doing so, broke the bonds of reality. Strange energies flowed into our world, allowing uncanny phenomena to take hold. Science and magic took new forms. People and creatures of other realms were cast into our own like jetsam in a turbulent tide. The isles are forever altered by the curse of these chaotic realities. |

> Quest Starter: An explorer brings news. They’ve located what they say is a nexus of chaotic energy. If it could be deactivated, the isles might find some measure of peace. Which power or foe seeks to harness this power to their own ends?
---
![[character.svg|20]] If you are all that remains of a pre-Sundering people, culture, or tradition, you might be a **[[AST_Vestive|VESTIGE]]**. If the echoes of the cataclysm have left you with unnatural powers, you might be a **[[AST_Sorcerer|SORCERER]]**. If you embody the legacy of a deep-dwelling people, you might be **[[AST_Waterborn|WATERBORN]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] A seafaring tribe seeks to locate and unite scattered people displaced during the Sundering. An order of sorcerers exploits the chaotic forces that caused the cataclysm.

*77 CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS*

## RELICS
What remains of lost or fallen people?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **The long history of the isles is marked by disaster, war, and exodus. Abandoned and ruined sites are grim monuments to these events.** |
|  | Former communities—even entire islands—are sometimes forsaken by their people. Others are lost and forgotten through the ravages of time. These places echo with the memories of lost lives, but also remind us of the perseverance of those who survived to carry on their traditions elsewhere. |

> Quest Starter: An uninhabited island is marked by the ruins of a once-great city. Someone important to you led an expedition to that island months ago, but has not returned. What were they in search of?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **Two centuries ago, a powerful empire dared to claim these isles as their own. Ruined places are all that remain to mark their hubris.** |
|  | The tattered banners of the fallen empire lie amid ravaged fortresses, wrecked ships, and abandoned cities. In some places, nature reclaimed these sites. In others, people return to build anew upon the graves of these former invaders. Meanwhile, scavengers—like gulls picking at the bones of dead fish—scour the remnants in search of plunder. |

> Quest Starter: The emperor wore a crown adorned with two gems of unsurpassed size and quality: a blue diamond to honor Wraith, and a fiery ruby to represent Cinder. The resting place of the emperor and this crown are a mystery—one you are determined to solve.

___

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **An ancient civilization of unfathomable power left its mark upon the isles.** |
|  | These people unlocked secrets beyond our understanding. The ruins marking their legacy are places of unnatural construction, confounding mechanisms, and cryptic relics. Some islanders revere the ancients. Others seek to understand them. A few have more selfish motives—pillaging the sites for treasure and artifacts. But some secrets are best left buried. Many ruins are cursed, corrupted by time, and haunted by malignant evil. |

> Quest Starter: Dozens of ancient towers have flared to life, sending up beacons of light visible from leagues away. These lodestars form a marked path that stretches well beyond the far horizon. Why do you set out to see where this path leads?

![[character.svg|20]] If you are dedicated to searching out mysteries or preserving the legacy of lost relics, you might be a **[[AST_Scholar|SCHOLAR]]**. If you deal in recovered or stolen relics, you might be a **[[AST_Peddler|PEDDLER]]**. If you delve wrecks and ruins to gather resources or riches, you might be a **[[AST_Scavenger|SCAVENGER]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] A society of researchers and archaeologists works to understand lost people and relics. A sacred order of caretakers protects age-old sites from trespassers and grave robbers. An underground ring of fortune seekers supplies a black market trade of stolen treasures.

*78 GETTING UNDERWAY* 

## MODERN ERA
What is the state of technology?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **It is an age of sail.** |
|  | Sailing ships navigate the farthest reaches and weather the fiercest storms. Their cannons unleash devastating barrages against rivals or raiders, and their crews wield muskets and blades to defend their decks. Some commanders plot a course through hazardous waters with chart and sextant, while others rely on a deeper understanding of sea and sky. But above all else, we trust in the loyalty of our shipmates and the strength of our vows. |
 
> Quest Starter: A famed shipwright, nearing the end of their life, seeks to build their magnum opus—a ship of uncompromising beauty and strength. What rare material do they require, and where is it found?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **It is an age of industry.** |
|  | The winds of change are upon us. Some of these innovations inspire awe—flying machines that sail among the clouds, metal diving bells that plumb the greatest depths, and mechanical limbs of intricate design to replace what was lost. But industry is also an insatiable fire. Mines, smelters, and factories reshape our lands to feed those flames. Titanic ships seek dominance of the isles. Is it only a matter of time before our steadfast wooden ships and the simple ways of our communities are relics of a bygone age? |

> Quest Starter: An iron submersible stalks seagoing passages. Why do you seek vengeance against this vessel’s commander?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **It is an age of wonders.** |
|  | Some have wielded ancient secrets and extraordinary science to power vessels, weapons, and other machines. Their ships are fitted with energized sails that augment the powers of wind and storm. Their cannons unleash volleys of infernal energies. A few commanders even count iron automatons, given life by improbable technologies, among their crew. Resisting these wonders is like casting a stone against a thunderstorm, and many see this new age as a portent of our doom. |
 
> Quest Starter: An enemy faction is building a colossal machine of fantastic destructive potential. What is the nature of this machine, and why are you sworn to see it destroyed?

![[character.svg|20]] If you hew to the traditions of shipbuilding and repair, you might be a **[[AST_Shipwright|SHIPWRIGHT]]**. If you understand the intricacies of machines, you might be a **[[AST_Gearhead|GEARHEAD]]**. If you are fitted with a mechanical enhancement, you might be **[[AST_Augmented|AUGMENTED]]**. If you are forged by ancient secrets or newfound technologies, you might be a **[[AST_Construct|CONSTRUCT]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] A shipwright’s guild honors and develops the age-old craft of shipbuilding. An industrialized trade company is ever-hungrier for raw materials. An order of artificers crafts extraordinary machines. A fellowship of outcast automatons must find their way in a world that largely sees them as tools or abominations.

*79 CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS*

## IRON VOWS  
What is the significance of iron and sworn vows?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **Some see iron vows as a vestige of a more superstitious age, but the tradition persists.** |
|  | Our forebears bound their promises to the strength and permanence of iron. Today, self-avowed Ironsworn respect this tradition by affirming their resolve with a time-honored phrase: “By iron, I vow.” Even those who forgo an iron totem say the words to lend solemnity to a promise, setting themselves on an honorbound course—wherever it may lead. |

> Quest Starter: The Iron Tide, a force of warships whose commanders and crews have taken up the vow of their fallen leader, is bound for local waters. What do they seek, and why do you swear your own vow to prevent it?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **The Ironsworn bind their honor to iron blades.** |
|  | Even in this age of cannon and rifle, a finely-wrought blade—whether sword or dagger, dirk or bayonet—remains a mark of skill and resolve. When the Ironsworn swear a vow upon a blade, we bind our commitment to the metal. If we forsake a vow, that iron must be abandoned. To be Ironsworn without a blade is to be disgraced. |

> Quest Starter: You carry a broken sword. How was it broken, and what must you do to be worthy of a reforged blade?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **Since the distant time when iron was first hammered into form, seafaring folk of this world carried iron bondstones as sacred keepsakes.** |
|  | Each bondstone is unique—a relic of kin and culture—passed from one generation to the next. They are said to connect the soul of its keeper to their homeland or loved ones as if by an invisible thread. Thus, if lost at sea, our spirit may return home rather than remain entombed in the remorseless depths. We swear our vows upon bondstones as promises that follow us to our death—and beyond. But bondstones can also embody the curses of lost lives and forsaken vows, and bearing that weight can make them feel as heavy as a ship’s anchor. |

> Quest Starter: A merciless and powerful raider wears the bondstones of their victims as trophies. One of those totems is rightfully yours. To whom did it previously belong?

![[character.svg|20]] If you are sworn to a cause, you might be **[[AST_Bannersworn|BANNERSWORN]]**. If you carry an honor-bound blade, you might be a **[[AST_Blademaster|BLADEMASTER]]**. If you fight for personal honor, you might be a **[[AST_Duelist|DUELIST]]**. If your vows are shared with those in your charge, you might be a **[[AST_Crew Commander|CREW COMMANDER]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] An order of Ironsworn wardens is dedicated to protecting the people of the isles. A band of iron privateers sells their vows—and their loyalty—to the highest bidder.  

*80 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## NAVIGATION  
How are people and places connected?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **We are scattered to the winds, but our connections persist.** |
|  | The people of the isles are often isolated. Trade and communication must overcome distance and the fickle nature of the surrounding waterways. Known passages are undone by tumultuous weather, capricious seas, or unforeseen conflicts. In spite of those challenges, skilled voyagers and their indomitable vessels are a tether that binds the people and places of remote seas into a greater community. |

> Quest Starter: The port city of Stormrest is a perennial center of community and trade within the isles. But this city is now cut-off by an invading or occupying force. Who threatens this longstanding refuge?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **We rely on the ancient traditions and knowledge of the Starmarked to navigate these perilous seas.** |
|  | The Starmarked have an uncanny sense of wind and tide, and bear the history of their travels as beautiful and intricate tattoos—etched in phosphorescent ink. Some of the places and passages pioneered by the Starmarked are now common knowledge, inscribed in charts and traveled widely. Others are coveted secrets, or lost to time and strife. The skills of the Starmarked make them highly valued as ship navigators, and some seek to exploit them to their own ends. |

> Quest Starter: In recent years, many Starmarked have not returned from expeditions into a remote area of the isles. Is there someone—or something—that does not want to be found?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **Bleakmists are a curse upon the isles, confounding navigation and severing connections between communities.** |
|  | Bleakmists are a damnable, seabound fog. Mariners tell of inexplicable sensations within the cursed waters of the mists—whispered voices, the ghostly clanging of ship bells, half-seen phantom shapes. Some bleakmists never dissipate, forming an enduring barrier that only the most foolhardy attempt to navigate. In other places, mists gather with little warning. Once you enter a bleakmist, it’s hard to predict where—or if—you’ll emerge. |

> Quest Starter: Someone will pay well for passage through an everlasting bleakmist. What do they seek on the other side?

![[character.svg|20]] If you are skilled at finding your way among the isles, you might be a **[[AST_Navigator|NAVIGATOR]]**. If you trailblaze inland paths, you might be an **[[AST_Overlander|OVERLANDER]]**. If you carry precious items on your expeditions, you might be a **[[AST_Courier|COURIER]]**. If you wield mystical powers over the wind to see a ship safely on its way, you might be a **[[AST_Windbinder|WINDBINDER]]**.  

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] A guild of navigators collects and safeguards charts of the isles. A coven of sea witches guides ships through cursed waters.

*81 CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS*

## EMPIRES  
How great is the threat of colonization and conquest?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **The Sundered Isles are free from imperial control—for now.** |
|  | The empires have only a minor presence; their outposts are isolated and pose little threat. But there are resources and riches to be exploited, and freedom is a fragile thing. Even now, imperial agents are said to be among us, working in the shadows, planting the seeds of conquest. |

> Quest Starter: A conflict between two nations is raging. Some suggest the war was sparked by imperial agents, working behind the scenes to destabilize the region and open a path for colonization. Can you convince the leaders of these powers to abandon their fighting and focus on the true threat?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **Imperial forces vie for dominion over the Sundered Isles.** |
|  | Imperial colonization and exploitation is a creeping tide that threatens to engulf the isles. Colonial governors oversee ever-expanding settlements, while powerful trade companies control key trade routes and resources. Imperial agents conduct missions of subterfuge and assassination. Treaties between the empires are forged and broken on a whim, and mariners can never be certain of what flag will fly over a port from one day to the next. |

> Quest Starter: Envoys and aristocrats gather for a gala at a governor’s manor house, where a priceless object will be on display as a demonstration of the governor’s power and wealth. If a clever thief were to abscond with that item, it would undermine the governor and foment suspicion among the attendees. What is this object?

|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **In the wake of a tumultuous war, a powerful empire prevailed. This supreme power holds the fate of the Sundered Isles in an iron grasp.** |
|  | A time before the empire is a fading memory. Today, their armies and fleets control large swaths of territory in the isles, and their expeditionary forces use coercion and warfare to expand their dominion ever further. Other nations are little more than vassals, their puppet governments loyal to the empire. But there are whispers that the empire has grown complacent. Is this the day the once-freeborn people of the isles relight the fires of revolution and reclaim their legacy? |

> Quest Starter: A valuable prisoner is held in an imperial fortress. Who is this person, and why are they the best hope for rebellion?

![[character.svg|20]] If you resolve disputes and secure anti-imperial alliances, you might be a **[[AST_Diplomat|DIPLOMAT]]**. If you battle empires with blades and daring, you might be a **[[AST_Swashbuckler|SWASHBUCKLER]]**. If you work in the shadows, you might be a **[[AST_Spy|SPY]]**. If you navigate court intrigues, you might be a **[[AST_Socialite|SOCIALITE]]**. If you are on the run from imperial forces, you might be a **[[AST_Fugitive|FUGITIVE]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] A tyrannical empire seeks to expand its domain. A secret network of insurgents fights an empire from within. A rebel alliance fans the flames of freedom.

## PIRACY
What influence do pirates wield?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **Pirates are merciless raiders.** |
|  | Pirates give no quarter to seagoing targets and raze settlements on a whim. Their loyalty is only to crew and captain, but even that bond is fragile. Ritualized duels to decide the captaincy or settle disputes are common, and a long-lived marauder is a rare thing. If you come upon a gray-haired pirate, be wary; they have outwitted sailors better than you a thousand times over. |

> Quest Starter: You possess one-third of a coded map said to lead to a fabled pirate treasure. What infamous pirates hold the other pieces? Will you form an uneasy alliance to collect and divide the treasure, or take the other pieces of the map by force?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | Pirates are fiercely independent, but bound by a shared code. A pirate crew is a power unto itself, a diverse band of fugitives, outcasts, and rebels who serve under a ship’s charter and have a say in the operation of the vessel. Pirates do not attack indiscriminately, and give quarter to those who ask for it. They are nevertheless vilified as barbarous murderers by trade guilds, imperial governors, and other powers in the isles. In some ways, this reputation serves them; fear is more powerful than the mightiest cannons or the sharpest swords. |

> Quest Starter: A former pirate, given a pardon and a letter of marque, has sent countless pirates to their doom. Who is this turncoat, and why do you plot to see their reign of the seas ended?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **A burgeoning pirate nation wields great influence.** |
|  | The marauder clans sail under the command of the Dread Court, a conclave of eight veteran pirates whose shrewd tactics positioned this nation of cutthroats as a rising power. Once each year, the pirate fleets gather at a port called Flotsam—an artificial island built from the husks of captured and ruined ships—to pay homage to the Court and make plans.  |

> Quest Starter: There are schisms within the Dread Court. An assassination has tipped the latest gathering into chaos and threatens the future of this burgeoning power. Will you work to restore the alliance, or use the mayhem to your own advantage?

![[character.svg|20]] If you hunt marauding pirates, you might be a **[[AST_Bounty Hunter|BOUNTY HUNTER]]**. If you serve among a band of pirates, you might be a **[[AST_Cutthroat|CUTTHROAT]]**. If you are a young greenhorn or stowaway among a pirate crew, you might be an **[[AST_Urchine|URCHIN]]**. If you stand in command of a pirate ship, you might be a **[[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] An alliance of pirates unites against a common enemy. A guild of pirate hunters collects bounties on wanted marauders. An imperial navy seeks to scour the seas of pirates and other enemies.

*83 CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS*

## RELIGION  
What is the role of faith?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **Our faith is as diverse as the people.** |
|  | Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our ancestors as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idolize the natural order of the world, and see the divine in the ebb and flow of the tides or the whirling dance of the stars. Then there are those who see this diversity as imperfection, who seek only to bend the world to their righteous will. |

> Quest Starter: A pilgrim seeks passage to remote and dangerous waters. What holy place do they seek?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **The gods enact their will through manifestations and miracles.** |
|  | We chronicle the visitations of the gods in our histories, and decipher their enigmatic purpose through sacred rites. In times of crisis, their earthly avatars have guided us through the upheaval. For many, faith in these gods offers meaning and fulfillment. For others, belief is a cudgel used by tyrannical leaders to divide or control us. For this reason, some people and cultures disavow the gods to follow a different path. |

> Quest Starter: You bear the mark of a god. The priests declare this as a sign you are chosen to fulfill a destiny. Do you accept this fate, and swear to see it through, or are you determined to see it undone? What force opposes you?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **The gods are dead.** |
|  | In a time before memory, the gods of the isles warred with each other. These seas were their battleground, and they ushered in an age of destruction that plunged all the lands into fire and darkness. In their death throes, they left behind areas of tainted seas and forsaken landscapes—a cursed corruption that lingers even today. The hubris of these fallen gods is a reminder of the empty promise of faith. |

> Quest Starter: A cult seeks to take control of a site reputed to hold an artifact of the fallen gods. What holy object do they seek? Why are you sworn to stop them?  

![[character.svg|20]] If you are an ardent follower of a religion or creed, you might be a **[[AST_Devotant|DEVOTANT]]**. If you follow a prophesied path, you might be **[[AST_Fated|FATED]]**. If you are cursed by the gods with foul luck, you might be a **[[AST_Jinx|JINX]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] A tribe of nature-worshipers is sworn to protect the Isles against despoilers. An order of zealous inquisitors hunts dissenters and heretics. A theocratic empire forces its oppressive beliefs upon others. An eldritch cult seeks to resurrect or awaken an ancient entity.

*84 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## MAGIC
What is the impact of supernatural forces?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **Magic does not exist.** |
|  | Some find comfort in the old ways. Mariners heed a thousand superstitions to help ensure a safe voyage. A few perform elaborate rituals to gain the favor of the wind or cast runes to divine one's future. But true magic—if it ever existed—is lost to us now. |

> Quest Starter: Someone close to you is accused of casting a curse upon a settlement. Will you defend this person and uncover the true cause of the settlement’s troubles?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **Magic is rare and mysterious.** |
|  | The isles lie at the nexus of the new and the old, science and superstition, the known and the inexplicable. This collision of realities is a powerful but chaotic force, and rare folk can manipulate these unstable realities to cast spells and perform rites. In some cultures, mystics are respected; in others, they are feared or even outcast. |

> Quest Starter: A powerful but outcast sorcerer lives alone on a faraway island. Why do you have urgent need of their abilities? What enemy or rival is on the hunt for this person?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **Magic is an ever-present, elemental force. ** |
|  | Magic is as constant as the winds and tides. Talented mystics exploit these energies to shape natural forces, divine the past and the future, and cast boons and curses. A few can even breathe unnatural life into the dead. Many mystics join guilds or serve under mentors to hone their craft, while others make do with raw, untrained talent. In spite of their uncanny nature, mystics are often hired as aides for powerful leaders, or to help guide ships on perilous voyages. But as the winds and tides are fickle, so is magic, and some fall prey to the dark curse of these forces. |

> Quest Starter: Someone you love is corrupted by cursed powers, and is set on a destructive course of vengeance. What caused their fall? Do you seek to save them or defeat them?

![[character.svg|20]] If you posses supernatural powers, you might be an **[[AST_Empath|EMPATH]]**, **[[AST_Kinetic|KINETIC]]**, **[[AST_Necromancer|NECROMANCER]]**, **[[AST_Seer|SEER]]**, **[[AST_Shade|SHADE]]**, **[[AST_Sorcerer|SORCERER]]**, or **[[AST_Windbinder|WINDBINDER]]**. If your unnatural abilities have made you a pariah, you might be an **[[AST_Outcast|OUTCAST]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] A circle of mystics protects ancient secrets and trains promising initiates. A sorcerous imperial guard uses its uncanny abilities to hunt down enemies of the empire. An order of witch hunters persecutes those with magical talents.

*85 CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS*

## BEASTS  
What is the nature of extraordinary creatures?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **Beasts are lost to myth, but the tales persist.** |
|  | For most, monstrous beasts are the stuff of fables. But a few who journey across trackless isles and unknown seas claim otherwise. Some even bear the scars of those alleged encounters. |

> Quest Starter: In the highland jungles of a remote island, a settlement is plagued by attacks from an unknown creature. Five dead in these last few months, and fear and suspicion is rampant. What is your connection to this place?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **Beasts lurk in watery depths and within the reaches of remote islands.** |
|  | All manner of creatures dwell among the isles—including rare and incredible beasts of legend. Among them are colossal great whales and elder rays, larger than our greatest ship, and blade-winged sea dragons. Some foolish souls hunt these creatures for riches or sport. Others revere and protect them. A few are beast-bonded, forming an enduring friendship with their beast-kin. |

> Quest Starter: The captain of a powerful ship lost something dear to them when battling a beast, and has sworn vengeance against the creature. What is the nature of this beast? Do you aid the captain in their ill-fated quest, or stand against them to protect the creature?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **Here, there be monsters.** |
|  | We are trespassers in a cursed realm of beasts. Monstrous lizards stalk the inland wilds. Flying reptiles with wings the size of topsails dwell in cliffside nests. Giant sharks and serpents cruise the coastal waters in search of prey. The much-feared Kraken, larger than the greatest warship, lurks in fathomless depths. And some ancient beasts are too monstrous, too horrible, for even our worst imaginings. |

> Quest Starter: Tales tell of the means of forming a bond with the mightiest of the world’s beasts, the Kraken. Many have undertaken this quest, but none have succeeded. What must you accomplish to gain an accord with the Kraken, and why would you face this trial?

![[character.svg|20]] If you are skilled at battling beasts, you might be a **[[AST_Slayer|SLAYER]]** or **[[AST_Harpooner|HARPOONER]]**. If you are bound to a beast, you might ride a **[[AST_Dragon|DRAGON]]** or summon **[[AST_The Kraken|THE KRAKEN]]**. If you transform into a beastly form, you might be a **[[AST_Shapechanger|SHAPECHANGER]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] An order of beast slayers defends ships and settlements from beast attacks. A beast-hunting trade company deals in trophies and resources gathered from slain creatures. A clan of beast-bonded folk protects their sacred companions.

## HORRORS
What dreadful forces haunt the Sundered Isles?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 1–33 | **Put enough grog in a sailor, and they’ll tell you stories of doomed ships and ghostly visitations. It’s nonsense.** |
|  | There’s enough to fear amid the isles without worrying about fanciful tales of ghosts and ghouls. Nonetheless, sailors are a superstitious folk. On dark nights, when a dead calm falls over the sea, they keep a wary eye for ships that sail heedless of the wind. |

> Quest Starter: Years ago, a ship bearing a stolen treasure was sunk in a fierce storm. But mariners report seeing this vessel sailing under the light of the Wraith moon, its sails tattered, its weather decks empty. It is a cursed ship, folks say, doomed to carry its ill-gotten treasure for all eternity. Why do you intend to prove or disprove this tale?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 34–67 | **The veil between life and death is as fragile as gossamer.** |
|  | In the darkest reaches of the isles, ghost ships stalk the seas, undead guardians protect ancient tombs, and drowned sailors emerge from the depths in search of absolution or vengeance. Others may scoff at these tales, but we know the truth—death waits for us all, but is not always an end. |

> Quest Starter: Your ship is haunted by its former captain. At night, they are sometimes seen on the quarterdeck, staring grimly at the distant horizon. What unfulfilled vow torments this restless spirit? Why do you swear to see it done?

---

|  |  |
|:---:| --- |
| 68–100 | **The damned and the dead are a plague upon the isles.** |
|  | We live in accursed times. The drowned and the buried do not rest. Tortured spirits hunt for retribution. Uncounted islands are blighted by dark forces. Cities and villages lie abandoned and forsaken, lost to a malevolent tide. We keep watch, craft wards, and offer prayers to keep the horrors at bay, but it is no use. They are coming. |

> Quest Starter: For generations, an infamous ghost fleet has haunted these seas, sending countless mariners to their doom. Why do you now seek to form an alliance with the cursed commander of this fleet?

![[character.svg|20]] If you are plagued by a ghost, you might be **[[AST_Haunted|HAUNTED]]**. If you dedicate yourself to battling undead or monstrous forces, you might be a **[[AST_Slayer|SLAYER]]**. If you have unnatural powers over death, you might be a **[[AST_Necromancer|NECROMANCER]]**.

![[rectangular_flag_chevron_white.svg|20]] An order of ghost-hunting occultists is sworn to vanquish the woken dead. The vampire clans sail the islands in their dreaded nightships, preying upon ships and settlements. A cabal of necromancers commands an undead fleet.

# SET YOUR FACTIONS
What people and powers inhabit your version of the isles? In this exercise, taking inspiration from your truths, you choose or envision a handful of influential factions.

These choices help set in motion the conflicts and interconnections of your setting, and provide inspiration for encounters at sea and ashore.

As part of this exercise, you’ll want to record some notes. Grab some index cards or notepaper, or open up a new page in your digital journal.

> Allow about 10–20 minutes for this exercise.

## INTRODUCE YOUR FACTIONS
Consider the outcome of the truths exercise. What important or interesting powers come to mind? Is there a single, oppressive empire? Multiple empires? What people and organizations inhabit the isles? Do supernatural forces wield power or authority in your world? For the purposes of this exercise, make note of three or four factions. You’ll encounter other people and powers through the course of your story, but this is enough to get things rolling.

> [!tip] Group Play
> If you are playing with others, take turns suggesting a faction. Use this as an opportunity to discuss character concepts, what brought you together as allies, and how a suggested faction can tie into your character’s background or motivations.

### RECORDING FACTION DETAILS
Give each faction a name and a short summary with a few commonly understood details. Two to four bullet points are about right. 

> Forsaken Fleet | ORGANIZATION
> - Infamous clan of pirates
> - Led by a marauder known as the Raven Queen
> - Sacked a major port town, and made it a refuge for outlaws and outcasts
> - Ships have black sails

### WANT INSPIRATION?
If you’d prefer to keep it simple, start with a placeholder description—for example, “Tyrannical Empire” or “Undead Pirates.”  If you’d like suggestions for factions, [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#^Faction-Societies|turn to pages 52–55]]. You’ll find brief summaries for factions across four categories: societies, organizations, empires, and the cursed. You can roll for a random faction, pick  from any list, or customize and combine options. Elaborate on your choices as you like, and consider any unanswered questions implied by the descriptions.

Let your selections—even random ones—support your truths in the previous exercise and your preferences for the campaign. If colonial empires are not present in your version of the isles or hold no influence, ignore them. If supernatural forces do not exist, you can treat cursed factions as myths or rumors.

You can also generate details with the [[3 - Oracles#FACTION ORACLES|Faction Oracles]] (page 176). Or use real-world history, other games, or media for inspiration—adjust and reimagine as needed.

*88 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## THE RELEVANCE TEST
For each faction you introduce, answer three questions.
1. Does this faction fit the world I am creating?
2. Can this faction motivate quests, connections, or threats for my character?
3. Can this faction interact with at least one other faction to create conflict or intrigue?

If the answer to any of those questions is “no,” rethink the faction or choose another. If the answers are only a tentative or qualified “yes,” that’s good enough. Let it simmer. You’ll have time to adjust, even once your story is underway.

## DEFINE FACTION RELATIONSHIPS
Now that you have a handful of factions to set loose in your world, you can brainstorm their relationships to help envision opportunities for conflict and drama in your story.

### CONNECT THE DOTS
Take a moment to consider how the factions relate to each other. Are they at war? Allied against a mutual foe? Is one supporting the other—perhaps in secret? For some factions, this might be obvious. An empire is likely in conflict with factions that stand against them. Pirate clans undertake piracy, although they may use discretion when choosing targets. Other relationships might be more nuanced.

Give each faction a relationship with at least one other faction. If you’re unsure, choose two factions, and use the table below to help frame the relationship of one to another. Reroll or adjust any result that doesn’t fit, or consider how that result might signal an unexpected relationship. If you’d like more options, you can also use the expanded version of this table [[3 - Oracles#FACTION RELATIONSHIP| on page 177]].

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1–10 | Antagonistic or at war with |
| 11–20 | Friendly or allied with |
| 21–30 | Holds leverage over |
| 31–40 | Indebted to |
| 41–50 | Maneuvering against |
| 51–60 | Requires support from |
| 61–70 | Shares a rivalry with |
| 71–80 | Shares power with |
| 81–90 | Splintered from |
| 91–100 | Trades resources or favors with |
  
### LINKING FACTIONS TO YOUR CHARACTER
If any of the factions offer a potential backstory, origin, or opposition for your character, make note of it. Factions can help ground your character’s place in the world and motivate them into action. 

### MARK IT DOWN
Add important relationship details to your summary card. Keep in mind that you are only deciding the commonly understood connection between those factions, and that further investigation or events may reveal a deeper or alternate truth.

If helpful, you can create a relationship map for factions as described on [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#FACTION RELATIONSHIP MAPS|page 51]]. But it might be best to save that for later. Let the factions and their relationships deepen through a session or two, and take what you’ve learned to craft a relationship map.

*89 SET YOUR FACTION*

# CREATE YOUR CHARACTER
What sent you on a path of peril and adventure? What role will you play among the isles? Let’s find out. Work through the character creation steps below. Adjust the order of these steps as you like.
> Allow about 20–30 minutes for this exercise.

Have your character sheet handy for this exercise. A printable sheet is included in the _Sundered Isles Playkit_ (available for download at ironswornrpg.com), or use your preferred digital app or virtual tabletop (VTT).

You also need your deck of asset cards, which includes a mix of original _Starforged_ assets and new _Sundered Isles_ assets. See the next page for details.

> ## CHARACTER CREATION WALK-THROUGH
### STEP 1: FORGE YOUR CHARACTER CONCEPT
Envision the broad strokes of your character concept. Who are you? What drives you? Keep in mind these pillars (see [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#YOUR CHARACTER|page 10 for details]]).
- ==You are Ironsworn==. What incident, need, or responsibility sends you on your quest-bound adventures?
- ==You are a seafarer==. What calls you or will send you to the sea? What skills or abilities set you apart?
- ==You are a rebel==. What faction, circumstance, or obligation do you resist? Who are your allies?

Need inspiration? Proceed to step 2 to generate foundational details of your character. If you’d rather lay the keel of your concept by picking path assets, go first to step 3.

### STEP 2: SEEK INSPIRATION
On [pages 92–93], you’ll find tables and prompts to flesh out your character with a backstory and characteristics. Use them to help envision your character. Make note of any interesting ideas or questions these tools evoke.

### STEP 3: CHOOSE TWO PATHS
Select two path assets from your _Sundered Isles_ deck ([[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#Asset Guide|pages 14–15]]). Choose assets that support an interesting character concept, reflect the nature of your world, and foster the stories that you and other players want to explore.

For guidance or inspiration, check the Persona tables on [[#YOUR PERSONA|pages 94–95]].

*90 GETTING UNDERWAY*

### YOUR SUNDERED ISLES ASSETS
As you begin this exercise, ready your deck using the outline and suggestions on [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#Asset Guide|pages 14–15]].

During the exercise, you select two paths from that deck to form a basic character concept. For example, you might be a **[[AST_Scoundrel|SCOUNDREL]]** and **[[AST_Socialite|SOCIALITE]]** or a **[[AST_Swashbuckler|SWASHBUCKLER]]** and **[[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]]**. Then, in the next exercise, you choose one  additional asset. Plus, if you begin your adventures in command of a seagoing vessel, you start with an undistinguished **[[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]]** or your **[[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]]** command vehicle.

> [!tip] ### BUILDING A TEAM WITH ALLIES
If you are working through this exercise with other players, take turns completing steps. Talk it through to create an interesting group with a reason to adventure together, but don’t get hung up on unnecessary details. Leave unanswered questions to figure out through the course of your story.

### STEP 4: NAME YOUR CHARACTER
Give your character a name. For inspiration, check the [[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER NAME|Names table on page 194]]. If you are known by a moniker or title, note that as well. Then, mark down your character’s pronouns.

### STEP 5: WRITE YOUR BACKGROUND VOW
What ambition, need, or commitment drives you? This is your background vow. Mark the vow and give it an epic rank. If you’re not sure, save it for later—or look for inspiration on an oracle table such as [[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER GOALS|Character Goals]] (page 193).

To learn more about your background vow, [[CRG_Background Vow|see page 107]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook.

### STEP 6: SET YOUR STATS AND METERS
Set your stats by arranging these values across edge, heart, iron, shadow, and wits in any order: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1. To learn more [[CRG_Set Stats and Meters#Set Your Stats|about your stats]], see the _Starforged_ rulebook (page 110).

Next, set your condition meters and momentum to their starting values. Set your health, spirit, and supply to 5. Set your momentum to +2, your max momentum to +10, and your momentum reset to +2.

### STEP 7: PREPARE TO TAKE COMMAND
In the next exercise, you decide if you begin your adventures with a ship of your own to command, as well as the nature of your ship and crew. You also choose a final asset to complete your character. Go to page 96 to take command.

*91 CREATE YOUR CHARACTER*

## YOUR BACKSTORY
What is your backstory? What events or compelling need put you on a path of adventure? If you’re not sure, roll or choose on this table for inspiration.

This table uses an optional cursed die, as indicated by the skull icon: [skull]. This is an extra ten-sided die added to an oracle roll—one distinct from your oracle dice. If the cursed die rolls a 10, your answer is cursed—take the value of your oracle dice and check the cursed version of the table for your answer. The notation beside the cursed icon guides you to the location of that table. In this case, it’s on the next page. For details on [[3 - Oracles#THE CURSED DIE|the cursed die]], see page 114.

## YOUR CHARACTERISTICS
Use any of the prompts below that are helpful. Answer the question yourself or check the indicated table for an answer. If a response is  uninteresting or a poor fit, ignore it. In fact, rejecting what doesn’t work is part of sharpening the focus.

*94 GETTING UNDERWAY*
*95 CREATE YOUR CHARACTER*

# TAKE COMMAND
In this exercise, you decide whether to explore your character’s progression as a seafarer through the course of your story, or begin in command of an able ship and crew. We’ll also wrap up your character by picking a final asset.

> Allow about 10–20 minutes for this exercise.

## CHOOSE YOUR COMMAND
Select from these three options. If you are playing with allies, pick a command together—irrespective of your individual roles. One of you might take on the position of captain, but everyone helps guide the ship and crew on their way.

> ### OPTION 1: NOVICE COMMAND
> You are in command of a ship, but it is a minor vessel of little repute. This is the default campaign start.
> 
> You are a greenhorn captain or fallen on bad times. Your crew is much like the ship—unremarkable. Some are inexperienced. Some are indifferent. But with time, you may grow to rely on one another. Your ship will come into its own, or you will claim another. Can you forge a worthy legacy among the isles?
> 
> Take the asset card for the incidental [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]]. Decide if it is light, medium, or heavy. If in doubt, make it light and envision it as a small sloop, ketch, or cutter—a nimble but fragile vessel. To learn more about this starting ship, see [page 17].

> ### OPTION 2: WORTHY COMMAND
> You are in command of an admirable vessel and able crew. You begin your story with the wind in your sails. Will you hold this ship and crew together amid the perils of the isles?
> 
> Take the [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] command vehicle asset. This asset is normally gained when you [[4 - Moves#ADVANCE|Advance]] and spend experience. But as a seasoned commander, you skip the queue and claim this prize at the start of your story. Learn more about the [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]] asset on [page 18].

> ### OPTION 3: NO COMMAND
> You do not have a ship or command of your own—yet. If you are a mariner, you serve under the command of a non-player character on their ship, or are stranded or marooned without a ship.
> 
> Or perhaps the sea has yet to sing its siren song, and your adventures are found ashore. You might traverse rugged island landscapes as a guide, skulk among the back alleys of a city-state as a street urchin, or navigate the intrigues of imperial politics as a secret insurgent. 
> 
> Either way, your destiny lies on a seabound course. Will you someday stand at the helm of your own mighty ship?

*96 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## SHIP HISTORY
If you have a command, envision how you claimed or earned the vessel. For inspiration, use the table below. If you sail under the command of a non-player character, you can use this table to give their ship a backstory.

> ### [skull] CURSED SHIP

|  |  |
| :---: | --- |
| 1–10 | Awarded by its former—and now dead—captain, who still haunts its decks |
| 11–20 | Bound to a role as its new commander by a beguiling curse |
| 21–30 | Cobbled together from salvage found within a graveyard of forsaken ships |
| 31–40 | Discovered within a hidden sea cave after calling to you in a dream |
| 41–50 | Found adrift in perfect condition, with no sign of the crew |
| 51–60 | Gifted by a dreadful entity in exchange for a dark favor |
| 61–70 | Granted in an accursed agreement, sealed in blood |
| 71–80 | Improbably found as a derelict well inland; moved and refloated with much effort |
| 81–90 | Raised from the sunken depths as a boon from the sea itself |
| 91–100 | Taken in spite of its cursed reputation, when no one else would sail it |

*97 TAKE COMMAND*

## SHIP CHARACTERISTICS
Envision the ship’s look and nature. For inspiration, use any of the prompts below. If a rolled response on a table doesn’t fit, reimagine it, reroll, or ignore it and move on.

- **What size is the ship?** Roll or choose once on the [[3 - Oracles#SHIP SIZE|Ship Size]] table (page 132). Ignore or reroll the “Force” results.
- **What aspects of the ship’s look or nature are obvious when first sighted?** Roll or choose once or twice on the [[3 - Oracles#SHIP FIRST LOOK|Ship First Look]] table (page 134).

| 1 - 8 | Eclectic mix of all sorts of folk |
| 9 - 14 | Adventurers and trailblazers, seeking the far horizon |

| 83 - 86 | Turncoat imperials, sworn against former compatriots |
| 87 - 90 | Unprincipled mercenaries, earning blood money |
| 91 - 100 | Roll twice; these groups are at odds |

For now, focus on the crew as a whole. Later, you can personalize key individual crewmembers. [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#COMMAND AND CREWS|See page 22]] for more on envisioning and managing a crew.

> ### [skull] CURSED CREW
> If you roll a curse for Crew Characteristics, take your result on that table and give them an eerie, supernatural, or dreadful aspect. Use the table below for inspiration.

*98 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## READY TO CLAIM YOUR FINAL ASSET?
Choose a final asset from these categories: ==Support Vehicle==, ==Module== (only if you command a [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]]), ==Path==, or ==Companion==. For the full list of recommended _Sundered Isles_ assets, [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#Asset Guide|see pages 14–15]].

Do not choose a Deed asset for your starting character. Those represent notable achievements and situations in your story, and are taken when you [[4 - Moves#ADVANCE|Advance]].

If you want to start simple, or you’d like to get a better sense of your character and their challenges before making a choice, feel free to bank this asset for later. Once your campaign is underway, you may claim the banked asset—choosing from the categories listed above—without paying an experience cost.

### CHOOSING CREW-RELATED ASSETS
If you command a crew and want to spotlight your role as their leader, take [[AST_Crew Commander|CREW COMMANDER]] as your final asset. If you command a pirate ship, the [[AST_Pirate Captain|PIRATE CAPTAIN]] asset gives focus to the ebb and flow of your fortunes as buccaneers. If you’d rather explore the evolution of your command through the course of your story, save them for when you Advance. To learn more about these command assets, [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#CREW-RELATED ASSETS|see page 23]].

### SET YOUR REMAINING CONDITION METERS
Set the integrity of your [[AST_Sailing Ship|SAILING SHIP]], [[AST_Flagship|FLAGSHIP]], or support vehicles to their max value. Also, set your ship’s hold supply to its max value. Finally, if you have a companion, set its health to its max value.

*99 TAKE COMMAND*

# CHART YOUR COURSE
In this exercise, you’ll chart key locations in a local area, including a few islands and a seaside settlement. This is where your adventures begin.

> Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise.

Have ready the ==navigation chart worksheet== and ==connections worksheet== from the _Sundered Isles Playkit_. You’ll also want something to record notes for the locations, such as your journal or a stack of notecards. If you are playing using a digital tool or prefer another template, you need space for notes and a simple map.

> [!tip] Group Play
> If playing with others, one of you can read or summarize each step of this exercise. Everyone can participate in making decisions, rolling on oracle tables, and embellishing narrative hooks. Keep things moving, and don’t get hung up on details. You’ll discover more about these  locations and the people who live there through play.

### WHAT IS A NAVIGATION CHART?
A ==navigation chart== is a local map of islands and surrounding features. Your charts help track the progress of your journeys and discoveries within a manageable scope. Over time, you may create several charts as you move beyond the bounds of your starting area.

Learn more about [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#CHARTING YOUR COURSE|navigation charts]] on page 34.

### NAVIGATING THE ORACLES
During this exercise, you generate details for your starting location using several oracles. It might be helpful to bookmark those sections now to make it easier to move back and forth.
- [[3 - Oracles#ISLAND ORACLES|Island Oracles]] (page 142)
- [[3 - Oracles#^Settlement-Oracles|Settlement Oracles]] (page 164)
- [[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER ORACLES|Character Oracles]] (page 186).

As you work through this exercise, roll or choose on the oracle tables as you like. Ignore or revise any details that don’t fit the established facts of your setting. 

### BUILDING OTHER REALMS
If you are sailing the skyfaring realm, this exercise helps generate a starting area with only minor reimagining. If you plan to adventure in the spacefaring realm, you should instead use the [[_CSG_Sector Creation Summary|Sector Creation Exercise]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook (page 114) to generate local planets and settlements.

> ### PREFER TO CUT AND RUN?
> If you want a more seat-of-the-pants start for your campaign, or already have an idea of a location you want to focus on, feel free to skip this exercise. This leaves the details to be discovered in play.

*100 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING REGION
As detailed on page 8, the folk of the isles divide these seas broadly into three regions. Choose your starting region and note it on your navigation chart worksheet.

> ### MYRIADS
> These principal isles are widely settled. If you want to sail busy trade routes between bustling settlements, while keeping a weather eye for enemy sails, start here.

> ### MARGINS
> Greater distances separate the islands and settlements within this region. If you want to navigate less-traveled waters between remote places, start here.

> ### REACHES
> Here the islands and people are most scattered and isolated, the seas most unfamiliar. If you want to sail on stranger tides, start here.

## STEP 2: SET FACTION INFLUENCE
The navigation chart worksheet includes a ==faction influence grid==. This tool helps manage the presence and dominance of factions in your starting area. Once your campaign begins, it can reveal the nature of encounters with ships and settlements.

Check your faction notes from the [[#SET YOUR FACTIONS|faction exercise]] (page 88). Which factions do you envision as having a role in this area? Choose a field of the grid for  each of them, using whichever rank seems most appropriate for that faction’s role in the area and your story: dominant, established, subsisting, diminished, or obscure.

Leave several slots blank. New factions can emerge in the course of your story.

Later in this exercise, you reference this grid to decide which factions have control of a key settlement. To learn more about the [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#FACTION INFLUENCE GRID|faction influence grid]], see page 50.

| DOMINANT 1–30 | ESTABLISHED 31–45 | ESTABLISHED 46–60 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hand of Theya | Forsaken Fleet |  |

| SUBSISTING 61–70 | SUBSISTING 71–80 | SUBSISTING 81–90 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Akiya Clans |  |  |

| DIMINISHED 91–94 | DIMINISHED 95–98 | OBSCURE 99–100 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acheron’s Armada |  |  |

*101 CHART YOUR COURSE*

## STEP 3: REVEAL ISLANDS
> ### [[3 - Oracles#ISLAND ORACLES|ISLAND ORACLES]]
> Page 142

In this step, you generate the broad characteristics of some islands to give your character places to explore when they must be away from the sea. These islands might also be home to settlements; you generate one of those in the next step.

First, determine the number of islands using the guide shown here. This isn’t necessarily the total number of islands in this area; it’s just a set of locations to give you a footing as your adventures get underway. Then, answer the following questions for each of the islands.

| **Region** | **Islands** |
| --- | --- |
| Myriads | 4 Islands |
| Margins | 3 Islands |
| Reaches | 2 Islands |

- **What is the island’s landscape?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#SIZE|Size]]_, _[[3 - Oracles#TERRAIN|Terrain]]_, and _[[3 - Oracles#VITALITY|Vitality]]_ tables (page 142), and take a moment to consider what those results imply about the location. Larger islands likely have varying landscapes, but these initial results are the dominant characteristics.
- **Where is the island located?** Pick a spot on your navigation chart and draw a rough shape for the island. Give it an island-like outline with squiggly coastlines, or just make it a circle or square. But keep it relatively small among the vast seas. You want enough room to add the additional known islands in the region and reveal new places in the course of your adventures. If it’s a larger island, feel free to put it at the edge of the chart and have it extend “out of frame.”
- **Are there neighboring islands?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#NEARBY ISLANDS|Nearby Islands]]_ table (page 143). If the island is part of a pair or group, add the minor islands to the map near the main island. In favorable weather, the members of an island pair or group are close enough to be visible from one another, requiring a short sail to travel from one to another. Keep it simple; the central island is your focus. You won’t generate details for the neighboring isles in this exercise, and they don’t count toward the number of islands in the region. They are like moons orbiting a home world.
- **What is its name?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#ISLAND NAME|Island Name]]_ table (page 147).

Write the island names on your chart, and create a section in your notes for island info. Leave space to add more later. When you visit or explore an island, you can generate or envision additional details.

> [!info] Map
> [island picture1] kairos 
> [island picture2] Amaryllis
> > [!summary] Kairos | ISLAND
> > - Medium Size
> > - Elevated Terrain (cliffs with plateau)
> > - Lush Jungles
> > - One small neighbor island


*102 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## STEP 4: BUILD A SEASIDE SETTLEMENT
> ### [[3 - Oracles#^Settlement-Oracles|SETTLEMENT ORACLES]]
> Page 164

In this step, you generate a settlement—a populated village, town, or city—as a hub for the start of the campaign. Settlements are located throughout the Sundered Isles, but tend to be sparser and smaller beyond the Myriads. Some settlements are as old as memory, and others are newly founded.

Answer the following questions to introduce the local settlement. This settlement might be an important location in the area, your homeport, or simply a potential destination as you make your way into these waters.
- **Where is the settlement located?** Pick an island and mark a location for the settlement along the shoreline.
- **How populous is the settlement?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#SETTLEMENT SIZE]]Settlement Size_ table (page 164).
- **What are the primary industries or activities?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#SETTLEMENT FOCUS\|Settlement Focus]]_ table (page 168), referencing the shore column.
- **Who is in control here?** Check your faction influence grid, and choose a controlling faction. Use what you know of the settlement and the factions to help guide this selection. If unsure, roll on the influence grid for a random result.
- **What is its name?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#SETTLEMENT NAME|Settlement Name]]_ table (page 175).

Optionally, add more details. This is appropriate if you envision your character starting at this location, or are using the settlement as a home port. If not, wait until you visit to reveal more.

- **What is the ambiance and architecture?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#SETTLEMENT AESTHETICS|Settlement Aesthetics]]_ table (page 165).
- **What is seen at first glance?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#SETTLEMENT FIRST LOOK|Settlement First Look]]_ table (page 166).
- **What else do I know of this place?** Roll on the _[[3 - Oracles#SETTLEMENT DETAILS|Settlement Details]]_ table (page 170) to reveal additional aspects or rumors.

Add the settlement name to your chart, and record the details in your notes.

> [!ifno] Map
> [island1] kairos

> > - Industries: Piracy, Smuggling
> > - Controlled by Forsaken Fleet
> > - Modest structures with an imposing stronghold and multi-level layout
> > - High-stakes gambling hall

*103 CHART YOUR COURSE*

## STEP 5: ADD NOTABLE LOCATIONS
Next, add one to three other locations to your starting area. This can include sea features or island landmarks. Use the table below for inspiration. Each location includes an open question—a prompt to answer or leave (for now) as a mystery.

### LOCATION DETAILS @1–3 | [skull] _page 105_

## STEP 6: ADD A LOCAL CONNECTION
In this step, you add an important character as a connection to the local area. This person might be a patron for your character—someone of shared purpose who petitions or sponsors your initial adventures—or a helpful acquaintance. But keep in mind that connections are not shipmates or companions. They are independent characters whose own lives occasionally intersect with your own.

> ### [[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER ORACLES|CHARACTER ORACLES]]
> Page 186

Answer these questions to create your local connection. If you are playing with others, this is a shared connection.
- **What is the connection’s role?** Decide their duty, expertise, or background. Their role offers a bonus when you make a move with their support—it should be general enough to be helpful, but specific enough to be flavorful. [[CSG_Create Local Connection#Give the Connection A Role|See page 124]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook for tips on connection roles.
- **What is their rank?** The connection’s rank represents the challenge of advancing the relationship. The higher the rank, the greater the narrative focus and trouble involved to eventually [[4 - Moves#FORGE A BOND|Forge a Bond]] with them. Choose a rank appropriate to their role and the level of involvement you want them to have in your story: troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic.
- **What drives them?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER GOALS|Character Goals]]_ table (page 193).
- **What is their name?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER NAME|Character Name]]_ table (page 194).
- **Are they linked to a faction?** Referencing your faction influence grid, decide if this connection has a relationship with a known faction.
- **Where are they found?** Choose a settlement or place on the map as the connection’s present location. If they are aboard a ship, note where it sails.
- 
Optionally, you can flesh out a connection with details using the questions below. If you’d prefer to keep it simple, wait until you interact with them to reveal more.

- **What are obvious characteristics of the connection?** Roll or choose on the [[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER FIRST LOOK|Character First Look]] table (page 186).
- **What item or gear is this person seldom without?** Roll or choose on _[[3 - Oracles#TRADEMARK ACCESSORIES|Trademark Accessories]]_ (page 190) or _[[3 - Oracles#TRADEMARK WEAPONS|Trademark Weapons]]_ (page 191).
  **What have I learned of this connection over time?** Roll or choose on the _[[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER DETAILS|Character Details]]_ table (page 192).

Record this person’s name, role, rank, and location on the connections worksheet, and add any interesting additional details to your journal or notes.

A reminder: Introducing this connection at the start of your campaign is essentially a “free” strong hit on the Make a Connection move.

> ### WANT MORE?
> If you envision your character having a more complete understanding of your starting area, repeat step 4 (page 103) to add another settlement or two. This may give you insight into relations among these settlements, but leaves less to uncover in the course of your story.

*106 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## STEP 7: NAME THE AREA
Lastly, give these local seas a name. For inspiration, use the [_Local Seas_ table (page 227)]. You’re nearly done! In the next exercise, you send your character on their perilous course.

> ### [[3 - Oracles#LOCAL SEAS|LOCALSEAS]]

# SET THE SCENE
In this final exercise, you decide where your story begins and identify a trouble worthy of an iron vow. You can make this exercise part of your first proper session of play, or use it to lay the keel for future play.

> Allow about 5–10 minutes for this exercise.
> 
## THE STATUS QUO
What is the situation for your character at the start of your campaign? Are you aboard a ship? Traveling overland? Arriving at a settlement? Meeting with a local connection? Using the map you created in the last exercise, consider where you find yourself or where you are bound. If you are playing with others, talk this over as a group.

As described on [[SI_CH2_Set the Scene|page 131]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook], you can start play with a prologue—a bit of character building and downtime before the adventure properly begins. Or you can start with a bang in medias res. The simple matter of “Where am I, and what am I doing?” can help inform the situations you face in your first session.

## THE INCITING INCIDENT
Near the start of your story, you [[4 - Moves#SWEAR AN IRON VOW|Swear an Iron Vow]] to follow a goal, face a problem, or undertake a mission. This inciting incident interrupts the status quo and propels you into action. Make it a dangerous or troublesome quest.

If you already have a quest in mind to kick-off your story, you’re all set. If not, consider the narrative fodder from the previous exercises.

### TRUTHS
- **Selected truths:** Which situations, conflicts, or dangers offer an opportunity for adventure?
- **Quest starters:** Are any of the adventure seeds worth pursuing?

### FACTIONS
- **Allied factions:** Do you undertake a mission for an allied faction?
- **Enemy factions:** Will you attack or undermine an enemy faction?

### CHARACTER
- **Paths:** Do you have any duties, skills, or goals that might motivate a quest?
- **Backstory:** Does your backstory imply a danger or goal?
- **Team:** If playing co-op, do you and your allies have a shared goal?

### COMMAND
- **Ship:** Is there some aspect of your ship’s nature or history that must be dealt with? If you don’t have a command, do you undertake a quest to gain a ship of your own?
- **Crew:** Is the ship’s crew facing an urgent need, hardship, or curse?

### LOCAL AREA
- **Settlement:** Are there any settlement aspects or projects that create an opportunity for a quest?
- **Connection:** Based on their role or goal, does your connection need something from you?
- **Locations:** Is there a location that requires investigation or some pressing trouble?

*108 GETTING UNDERWAY*

## NEED INSPIRATION?
Check [[CFG_Inciiting Incident#What Make a Good Inciting Incident|page 129]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook] for details on creating a worthy inciting incident.

If you’re still unsure how to get things started, roll on a table or two and see what drives your character at the start of the story. Here’s some suggestions:

- A task from a patron or connection: _[[3 - Oracles#ACTION|Action]]_ + _[[3 - Oracles#THEME|Theme]]_ (pages 116–117)
- An incident at sea: _[[3 - Oracles#SEAFARING PERIL|Seafaring Peril]]_ (page 128)
- A personal mission: _[[3 - Oracles#CHARACTER GOALS|Character Goals]]_ (page 193)
- A mysterious treasure map: _[[3 - Oracles#TREASURE LOCATION|Treasure Location]]_ (page 220)

If all else fails, make something happen! Marauders attack. The sails of a tempting prize appear on the horizon. A dying mariner hands you a bloodstained map. Imperial soldiers arrive in force. A fancy gala is interrupted by a murder (or a murder is interrupted by a fancy gala). Envision what your character is doing and what event might put them on storm-tossed seas—literally or figuratively.

Forcing your character into action ripples outwards to create new opportunities and complications.

## THROW OFF THE BOWLINES
That’s it! You’ve decided the truths of the isles, forged powerful factions, created a character, launched a ship and crew, mapped the local waters, and envisioned the situation at the start of your story.

If you are new to the _Starforged_ system and want more details on swearing and undertaking your initial vow, see [[CFG_First Vow|pages 132–134]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook. Otherwise, it’s time to set sail.

Keep in mind: these exercises were a foundation, not a mandate. If you decide to change an established aspect of the campaign—or events in your story reveal their own truth—that’s okay! Keep what you like. Change or discard what you don’t. Play to see what happens.

Fair weather and following seas, Ironsworn!
