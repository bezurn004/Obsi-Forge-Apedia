## Oracle: Tokens
> [!mechanics]- | Roll > %%GetDice%% | Guidance
> A token is an item of personal significance—such as a memento, heirloom, or individual treasure. Use this table when prompted by another table, or to add detail to a character. A token might have intrinsic value, but is often a thing of worth only to its owner. Not all treasures are silver and gold. ^guidance-OclTokens
