# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch3_Contents|Oracles]]: Revealing the Isles
This section contains an array of generators and random tables to help envision situations, encounters, and locations among the isles.

## USING THE ORACLES
### RESULTS BY REGION
Some location oracles are structured with results organized by the main regions of the isles: ==Myriads==, ==Margins==, and ==Reaches==. Check the result for your current location. If you are playing in another setting, you can think of those regions as translating to ==Inhabited==, ==Frontier==, and ==Remote==.

### MULTIPLE RESULTS
Some oracles provide a recommended number of rolls. For example: ==@1–2==. Depending on the situation, you might make multiple rolls at once, or make them over time to “peel the onion” and reveal new aspects.

All other tables are assumed to default to a single roll, but some oracles include an embedded result that prompts you to make multiple rolls. This is typically shown as ==“Roll twice.”== If you get this result, roll twice more on the table and combine those results. If you get “Roll twice” yet again, ignore it and redo the roll.

### LINKS TO OTHER TABLES
Oracle answers often prompt you to jump to another oracle. This is shown as an arrow symbol with the name(s) of the oracle. For example: ==▶Island==. If you see this prompt, that’s your cue to go to that section or table to reveal more about the encounter or location. If you are reading this rulebook on a digital device, the included page references are clickable.

> ### MIXING AND MATCHING ORACLES
The _Sundered Isles_ oracle tables are primarily intended for a seafaring setting, but many are flexible enough to incorporate into your _Starforged_ spacefaring campaigns or _Ironsworn_ fantasy campaigns—or even other roleplaying games. For example, the _[[_SI_CH3_Faction Oracles|Faction Oracles]]_ (page 176) are useful for a wide variety of settings, and the _[[SI_CH3_Misc_Travel|Interlude Scene]]_ table (page 228) can help prompt the nature of a character-focused downtime scene in any campaign.

Inversely, the _Starforged_ oracles are useful for swashbuckling campaigns set in the spacefaring realm, helping generate the details of planets, spacegoing encounters, strange creatures, and ancient alien vaults.

In short, the _Sundered Isles_ oracles provide the essentials for adventures in a seafaring world, but feel free to mix and match from other sources to create your perfect oracle kit.

## PICK YOUR POISON
When you [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]] a question that leads you to this section, consider your approach and preferences. For any particular situation, you might have several tables to choose from.

Some oracle tables are abstract. For example, the _[[SI_CH3_Core_Action Theme#ACTION|Action]]_ oracle (page 116) offers single-word prompts. This table can be combined with others to add nuance—such as using _[[SI_CH3_Core_Action Theme#THEME|Theme]]_ (page 117) to form a verb/noun combination—but the result still relies on your creative interpretation. Deciphering these answers, realizing how they connect to situations in your story, experiencing those eureka moments, is part of the fun of playing _Starforged_ and _Sundered Isles_.

Other oracle results are general. They provide room to clarify or expand, but are less cryptic than the abstract tables. For example, the _[[SI_CH3_Seafaring Fortunes#Oracle Seafaring Peril|Seafaring Peril]]_ table (page 128) includes prompts for unfortunate events that might befall your ship, but the exact nature of each event is left to the players to suss out. You may decide those answers yourself, or [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle (SI Moves)]] yes/no questions to clarify.

And some oracle tables are specific. A _[[SI_CH3_Character_Names#Oracle Character Name|Character Name]]_ (page 194), for example. Or _[[SI_CH3_Overland Details#Oracle Overland Details|Overland Details]]_ (page 156). The more precise the result, the more flavorful or actionable, but the less open to creative interpretation. This is especially true when playing in the world of the _Sundered Isles_, because the oracle tables are keyed to the setting. If you are playing in another world, or chose to explore the skyfaring or spacefaring realms when you [[SI_CH2_Select Your Realm|laucned your campaign]] (page 69), you may find abstract and general prompts more useful.

With some play time under your belt, you’ll become familiar with the structure of the oracles and find your preferred approaches.

## OTHER REMINDERS
The tables in this section are a tool. Use them as you like to help envision the world, introduce encounters and events, and move your story forward. Here are a few additional tips for making the most of the oracles. [[OCL_Using Oracles|See page 291]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook for more.

- **Use tables as a pick-list:** Oracles aren’t just for rolling. You’re free to scan a table and pick an option that is a good fit. This is particularly true when building on established facts. However, remember that the generators—particularly for locations, characters, and ships—are often structured to include a mix of common and rare answers. For example, an encountered ship might be carrying treasure, but this is a rare find as defined by the odds of the _[[SI_CH3_Ship Boarding#Oracle Ship Cargo|Cargo]]_ table (page 139). Follow the fiction, treating unusual events and discoveries as special.
- **Peel the onion:** When initially encountering a location, character, or ship, use the oracle tables for details you would perceive as first impressions, such as the Character First Look table (page 186). Make a roll or two, envision the result as appropriate to the situation, make some assumptions to fill in the gaps, and move on with your story. Then use other tables to reveal new details over time.
- **Build oracle arrays and campaign elements:** An oracle array helps you choose from among a set of relevant tables, while a campaign elements oracle reveals the focus of an encounter or situation. [[OCL_Using Oracles#More Oracle Options|See pages 384-385]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook for details.
