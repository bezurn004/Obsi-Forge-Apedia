# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch3_Contents|Oracles]]: The Cursed Die
Are the isles haunted by supernatural forces, monstrous foes, and strange technologies? You can introduce these dread aspects when you define your setting truths. Or perhaps you will discover them—or wake them—in the course of your story. Either way, use the ==cursed die== to reveal the uncanny, horrifying, and chaotic facets of your world.

## ASK THE (CURSED) ORACLE
Many random tables in this book are marked with a small skull icon: [skull] When you use one of those tables for inspiration, you may roll a cursed die alongside your oracle dice. Like your oracle dice, the cursed die is ten-sided, but should be a special color or material to distinguish it from the oracle dice. Choose a die that evokes an eerie quality. A malevolence.

After making your oracle roll, look at the value of your cursed die. Is it a 10 (often signified by a 0 or 00 on a ten-sided die)? If so, your answer is ==cursed==, and you should check the cursed version of that table for your answer. The cursed table is often on the same page or the next page. If in doubt, a page number next to the small cursed icon shows the way. Cursed tables are marked with a large version of the skull icon.

### CUSTOMIZING YOUR CURSED EXPERIENCE
Roll the cursed die only when the potential for a cursed answer is wanted and appropriate. If you establish that a location or encounter is mundane, omit the cursed die when generating new details. If you prefer a setting without supernatural aspects, ignore this mechanic altogether. On the other hand, if you face a situation where a cursed answer is obvious and interesting, go directly to a cursed table.

If you want to further fine-tune the odds of a cursed result to fit the situation, here are some options.
- Increase the range of a cursed result by triggering it on 9–10 or 8–10.
- Increase the chance of a cursed result by adding one or two cursed dice to your oracle roll. If any die rolls 10, the result is cursed.
- Use a full set of polyhedrals as your cursed dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20

When adding a cursed die to a roll, choose one. If you roll the highest value on that die—for example, 4 on a D4—the result is cursed. Thus, a fewer-sided die increases the odds of a cursed result, while a many-sided die makes it less likely.

### MORE CURSES
If you want to give the cursed die more emphasis in your session, use these techniques.
- Roll a cursed die alongside abstract oracles such as _[[SI_CH3_Core_Action Theme#ACTION|Action]]_ and _[[SI_CH3_Core_Action Theme#THEME|Theme]]_. These tables don’t have dedicated cursed alternatives, but you can resolve a cursed result by envisioning the nature of the prompt as frightening or uncanny.
- When you Ask the Oracle and use the yes/no table to divine an answer, toss your cursed die into the mix. If you roll a curse, envision how the answer includes a dreadful twist.

## Cursed Dice Configuration
_Use the below table to configure the cursed dice for the dice roller equations listed just above each Oracle table. If you wish to customize this table for the various options listed above, add cursed results or change the table dimensions. For multiple cursed dice rolled at once, create a duplicate table, then create a lookup table that rolls on both tables and returns the CURSED result when one of the results matches the criteria._
