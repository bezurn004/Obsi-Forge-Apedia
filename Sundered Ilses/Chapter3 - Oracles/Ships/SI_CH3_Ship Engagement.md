# [[_Sundered Isles|Sundered Isles]] - [[_SI_Ch3_Contents|Oracles]] - [[_SI_Ch3_Ship Oracles|Ship]]:  Engagement
As you enter the engagement scope for a ship, generate the **ship mission** and **details.**

## Ship Mission Oracles
A ship’s faction can reveal its role, such as warship, tradeship, or whaler. If the ship is independent, the faction unknown, or if you simply want more detail, use this table. Alternatively, use the [captain’s goal (page 193)] to set the ship’s purpose.

_This is the consolidated table from the source material. For rollable results for a certain ship size / fleet, see the sub tables below ordered by size._
