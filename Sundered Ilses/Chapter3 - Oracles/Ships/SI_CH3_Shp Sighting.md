## Oracle: Ship Size
> [!mechanics]- | Guidance
> Use this table to generate the scale of a ship sighting, ranging from a single small ship to a massive armada. The challenge ranks shown here are a starting place. Set the rank of a naval fight as appropriate to the capability of your forces and the complexity of your objectives. Also, keep in mind that ships operate at a scale relative to other large vehicles and creatures. For tips on handling naval encounters, [[SI_CH1_Naval Encounters|see page 36]]. ^guidance-OclShipSize
