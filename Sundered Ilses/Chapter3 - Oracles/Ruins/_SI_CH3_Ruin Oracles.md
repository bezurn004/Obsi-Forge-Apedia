## SUMMARY: EXPLORING A RUIN
Use the exploration moves [(page 242)] to investigate a notable ruin. If you are diverting from an overland or seafaring expedition to check out a ruin of minor scale, you can [[SI_CH4_Explore a Waypoint#Explore a Waypoint Move Card|Explore a Waypoint]] to resolve the survey with a single move. For a larger ruin, give it a challenge rank as you begin a new expedition. Then, within a ruin, use the _[[SI_CH3_Ruin_Investigation#Oracle Ruin Feature|Features]]_ table to inspire the details of a waypoint, the _[[SI_CH3_Ruin_Fortunes#Oracle Ruin Peril|Peril]]_ table when you face a cost, and the _[[SI_CH3_Ruin_Fortunes#Oracle Ruin Opportunity|Opportunity]]_ table if you encounter good fortune.

### UNCOVERING MYSTERIES WITHIN RUINS
You do not delve into ruins to loot and defile. Instead, you seek to learn more about the people who once inhabited a site and the fate that befell them. To that end, your progress on an expedition doesn’t just represent the physical spaces you traverse. Marking progress also signifies your deepening understanding of that place’s legacy.

To explore the secrets of a mysterious ruin, follow this procedure.
- When you first mark progress within a ruin, envision a mystery that reveals itself, a question that prompts further investigation. Check the _[[SI_CH3_Ruin_Investigation#Oracle Ruin Mystery|Ruin Mystery]]_ table on page 216 for inspiration, or simply decide the mystery based on whatever quest or circumstance drew you to this site.
  
- After that, as you reach a waypoint and mark progress, you can envision uncovering a cipher—a feature, object, or encounter that delivers a new clue. Use the _[[SI_CH3_Ruin_Investigation#Oracle Ruin Cypher|Ruin Cipher]]_ table (page 216) for inspiration of what form it takes. For details of the clue itself, [[SI_CH4_Ask the Oracle#Ask the Oracle Move Card|Ask the Oracle]] yes/no questions, use _[[_SI_CH3_Core Oracles|Core Oracles]]_ (pages 116–119) for an abstract prompt, or check the _[[SI_CH3_Misc_Story#Oracle Story Clue|Story Clue]]_ table (page 231). If the nature of the cipher is complex or inscrutable, such as a puzzle or cryptic message, make appropriate moves to reveal or understand the clue. Envision how the clue fits into the evolving nature of the mystery, while leaving unanswered questions.
  
- When you prepare to [[SI_CH4_Finish a Scene#Finish a Scene Move Card|Finish a Scene]], consider the nature of the mystery and the clues you have uncovered, and propose a solution. The outcome of the progress roll as you [[SI_CH4_Finish a Scene#Finish a Scene Move Card|Finish a Scene]] reveals whether your assumptions are correct, or if you have been led astray.
