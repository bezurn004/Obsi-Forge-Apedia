## Oracle: Interlude Scene
> [!mechanics]- | Roll > `dice: [[SI_CH3_Misc_Travel^table-OclInterludeScene]]` | Guidance
> If you want to explore a character interlude, or are prompted by another table to trigger an interlude at a waypoint, check the table below for inspiration. Then, for more detail on a scene’s focus—such as the nature of a dream or the cause of a dispute—roll on any combination of the _[[_SI_CH3_Core Oracles|Core Oracles]]_ (pages 116–119) and interpret the response. To learn more about character [[SI_CH1_Interludes|interludes]], see page 46. 
> > The cursed die is not rolled by default on the Interlude Scene table. However, if you’re interested in giving the scene a supernatural atmosphere, add the cursed die to your roll—or just make it happen.
> 
> > On a cursed result, take your result from the Interlude Scene table and envision how it gains an eerie or mystical mood. But keep it low-key. A subtle ghostly manifestation. A strange but alluring environmental phenomenon. A spooky story told on a fog-shrouded evening. ^guidance-OclInterludeScene
