## Oracle: Ship Damage
> [!mechanics]- | Roll > <br>Bothersome: `dice: [[SI_CH3_Misc_Combat^table-OclShipDamage-Bothersome]]`<br>Bad: `dice: [[SI_CH3_Misc_Combat^table-OclShipDamage-Bad]]`<br>Critical: `dice: [[SI_CH3_Misc_Combat^table-OclShipDamage-Critical]]`  | Guidance
> Use this table to help envision the nature of damage to your ship or impact on your crew. Use this in dramatic situations, such as suffering a miss with a match in a naval fight, or rolling a miss to [[SI_CH4_Withstand Damage#Withstand Damage Move Card|Withstand Damage]]. The result will introduce complications and looming catastrophes that must be dealt with.
> 
> For an initial hit, make the issue bothersome, and roll to learn what aspect of your ship is impacted. Then, if you don’t address the problem or suffer another hard hit, step up the severity. For example, a weakened mast is splintering, or a shaken crew is breaking. You should treat critical damage separately from your ship’s general integrity, requiring the “repair any other component or device” option in the Repair move.
> 
> You can also roll on this table to reveal damage on a ship other than your own, such as when boarding a vessel after a fierce battle. If so, let your oracle roll serve double-duty by also indicating the severity. Assume the damage is bothersome on an odd roll, bad on an even roll, and critical if you roll a number divisible by 10 (10, 20, 30…). ^guidance-OclShipDamage
