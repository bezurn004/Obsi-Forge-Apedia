## SUMMARY: EXPLORING A CAVE
Use the [[_SI_CH4_Exploration Moves|exploration moves]] (page 242) when you delve a notable cave and want to give it focus in your story.

In the twisting waterways of a sea cave ([[SI_CH3_Sea Cave Details#Oracle Sea Cave Feature|pages 208–209]]), you likely travel by boat through a world of tide, rock, and shadow. You may be forced to portage over shallows and high ground, or even abandon your boat as you struggle through tight spaces or desperately navigate completely flooded tunnels.

In an inland cave ([[SI_CH3_Inland Cave Details#Oracle Inland Cave Feature|pages 210–211]]), you follow labyrinthine paths along claustrophobic tunnels and through cavernous chambers. Envision the oppressive weight of the stone around you, the impenetrable darkness, the unnerving echoes. 

Use the _Features_ table to inspire the details of a waypoint, the _Peril_ table when you face a cost in your travels, and the _Opportunity_ table if you encounter good fortune. But remember these tables are only a complement to your own storytelling choices.

### LURKING THREATS
Time is your enemy within a cave. To emphasize the growing tension of underground expeditions, add a tension clock for a lurking threat. When you suffer a cost through failure, delay, or inaction, you can advance the clock to show the threat drawing closer. Learn more about [[GID_Clocks_Tension|tension clocks]] on page 238 of the _Starforged_ rulebook.

The table on the next page includes inspiration for lurking threats, including what signs you encounter as the tension clock advances, and what occurs when the clock fills.

### REACHING THE HEART
The heart of a cave is the epicenter of an underground domain. If you are on an expedition without a specific mission, the heart can serve as your destination. If you are seeking to make progress in a quest, what lies at the heart gives context to the final challenges or opportunities you uncover when the expedition is done.

When you [[SI_CH4_Finish an Expedition#Finish an Expedition Move Card|Finish an Expedition]], envision what lies at the cave’s heart, or use the table included with each cave type for inspiration. Once you reach a cave’s heart and resolve the expedition, you can [[SI_CH4_Set a Course#Set a Course Move Card|Set a Course]] to shortcut your exit.
