If you face a cost in your travels, such as when you roll a miss as you [[SI_CH4_Undertake an Expedition#Undertake an Expedition Move Card|Undertake an Expedition]], the _[[#Oracle Seafaring Peril|Seafaring Peril]]_ (pg 128) oracle can help reveal what occurs. If you encounter good fortune, such as when you roll a strong hit with a match, the _[[#Oracle Seafaring Opportunity|Seafaring Opportunity]]_ (page 129) table can inspire the nature of this lucky break. Check those tables instead of—or in addition to—a seafaring waypoint. _[[SI_CH3_Seafaring Waypoints#Oracle Unknown Waters|From page 121]]_
