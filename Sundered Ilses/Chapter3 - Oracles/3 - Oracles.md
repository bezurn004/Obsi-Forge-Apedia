# REVEALING THE ISLES
This section contains an array of generators and random tables to help envision situations, encounters, and locations among the isles.

## USING THE ORACLES
### RESULTS BY REGION
Some location oracles are structured with results organized by the main regions of the isles: ==Myriads==, ==Margins==, and ==Reaches==. Check the result for your current location. If you are playing in another setting, you can think of those regions as translating to ==Inhabited==, ==Frontier==, and ==Remote==.

### MULTIPLE RESULTS
Some oracles provide a recommended number of rolls. For example: ==@1–2==. Depending on the situation, you might make multiple rolls at once, or make them over time to “peel the onion” and reveal new aspects.

All other tables are assumed to default to a single roll, but some oracles include an embedded result that prompts you to make multiple rolls. This is typically shown as ==“Roll twice.”== If you get this result, roll twice more on the table and combine those results. If you get “Roll twice” yet again, ignore it and redo the roll.

### LINKS TO OTHER TABLES
Oracle answers often prompt you to jump to another oracle. This is shown as an arrow symbol with the name(s) of the oracle. For example: ==▶Island==. If you see this prompt, that’s your cue to go to that section or table to reveal more about the encounter or location. If you are reading this rulebook on a digital device, the included page references are clickable.

> ### MIXING AND MATCHING ORACLES
The _Sundered Isles_ oracle tables are primarily intended for a seafaring setting, but many are flexible enough to incorporate into your _Starforged_ spacefaring campaigns or _Ironsworn_ fantasy campaigns—or even other roleplaying games. For example, the _[[#FACTION ORACLES|Faction Oracles]]_ (page 176) are useful for a wide variety of settings, and the _[[#INTERLUDE SCENE|Interlude Scene]]_ table (page 228) can help prompt the nature of a character-focused downtime scene in any campaign.

Inversely, the _Starforged_ oracles are useful for swashbuckling campaigns set in the spacefaring realm, helping generate the details of planets, spacegoing encounters, strange creatures, and ancient alien vaults.

In short, the _Sundered Isles_ oracles provide the essentials for adventures in a seafaring world, but feel free to mix and match from other sources to create your perfect oracle kit.

*112 ORACLES*

## PICK YOUR POISON
When you [[4 - Moves#ASK THE ORACLE|Ask the Oracle]] a question that leads you to this section, consider your approach and preferences. For any particular situation, you might have several tables to choose from.

Some oracle tables are abstract. For example, the _[[#ACTION|Action]]_ oracle (page 116) offers single-word prompts. This table can be combined with others to add nuance—such as using _[[#THEME|Theme]]_ (page 117) to form a verb/noun combination—but the result still relies on your creative interpretation. Deciphering these answers, realizing how they connect to situations in your story, experiencing those eureka moments, is part of the fun of playing _Starforged_ and _Sundered Isles_.

Other oracle results are general. They provide room to clarify or expand, but are less cryptic than the abstract tables. For example, the _[[#SEAFARING PERIL|Seafaring Peril]]_ table (page 128) includes prompts for unfortunate events that might befall your ship, but the exact nature of each event is left to the players to suss out. You may decide those answers yourself, or [[4 - Moves#ASK THE ORACLE|Ask the Oracle]] yes/no questions to clarify.

And some oracle tables are specific. A _[[#CHARACTER NAME|Character Name]]_ (page 194), for example. Or _[[#OVERLAND DETAILS|Overland Details]]_ (page 156). The more precise the result, the more flavorful or actionable, but the less open to creative interpretation. This is especially true when playing in the world of the _Sundered Isles_, because the oracle tables are keyed to the setting. If you are playing in another world, or chose to explore the skyfaring or spacefaring realms when you [[2 - Getting Underway#SELECT YOUR REALM|launched your campaign]] (page 69), you may find abstract and general prompts more useful.

With some play time under your belt, you’ll become familiar with the structure of the oracles and find your preferred approaches.

## OTHER REMINDERS
The tables in this section are a tool. Use them as you like to help envision the world, introduce encounters and events, and move your story forward. Here are a few additional tips for making the most of the oracles. [[SF_CH5_Using Oracles|See page 291]] in the _Starforged_ rulebook for more.

- **Use tables as a pick-list:** Oracles aren’t just for rolling. You’re free to scan a table and pick an option that is a good fit. This is particularly true when building on established facts. However, remember that the generators—particularly for locations, characters, and ships—are often structured to include a mix of common and rare answers. For example, an encountered ship might be carrying treasure, but this is a rare find as defined by the odds of the _[[#CARGO|Cargo]]_ table (page 139). Follow the fiction, treating unusual events and discoveries as special.
- **Peel the onion:** When initially encountering a location, character, or ship, use the oracle tables for details you would perceive as first impressions, such as the [[#CHARACTER FIRST LOOK|Character First Look]] table (page 186). Make a roll or two, envision the result as appropriate to the situation, make some assumptions to fill in the gaps, and move on with your story. Then use other tables to reveal new details over time.
- **Build oracle arrays and campaign elements:** An oracle array helps you choose from among a set of relevant tables, while a campaign elements oracle reveals the focus of an encounter or situation. [[SF_CH5_Using Oracles#More Oracle Options|See pages 384–385]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook for details.

*113 REVEALING THE ISLES*

# THE CURSED DIE
Are the isles haunted by supernatural forces, monstrous foes, and strange technologies? You can introduce these dread aspects when you define your setting truths. Or perhaps you will discover them—or wake them—in the course of your story. Either way, use the ==cursed die== to reveal the uncanny, horrifying, and chaotic facets of your world.

## ASK THE (CURSED) ORACLE
Many random tables in this book are marked with a small skull icon: [skull] When you use one of those tables for inspiration, you may roll a cursed die alongside your oracle dice. Like your oracle dice, the cursed die is ten-sided, but should be a special color or material to distinguish it from the oracle dice. Choose a die that evokes an eerie quality. A malevolence.

After making your oracle roll, look at the value of your cursed die. Is it a 10 (often signified by a 0 or 00 on a ten-sided die)? If so, your answer is ==cursed==, and you should check the cursed version of that table for your answer. The cursed table is often on the same page or the next page. If in doubt, a page number next to the small cursed icon shows the way. Cursed tables are marked with a large version of the skull icon.

### CUSTOMIZING YOUR CURSED EXPERIENCE
Roll the cursed die only when the potential for a cursed answer is wanted and appropriate. If you establish that a location or encounter is mundane, omit the cursed die when generating new details. If you prefer a setting without supernatural aspects, ignore this mechanic altogether. On the other hand, if you face a situation where a cursed answer is obvious and interesting, go directly to a cursed table.

If you want to further fine-tune the odds of a cursed result to fit the situation, here are some options.
- Increase the range of a cursed result by triggering it on 9–10 or 8–10.
- Increase the chance of a cursed result by adding one or two cursed dice to your oracle roll. If any die rolls 10, the result is cursed.
- Use a full set of polyhedrals as your cursed dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20

When adding a cursed die to a roll, choose one. If you roll the highest value on that die—for example, 4 on a D4—the result is cursed. Thus, a fewer-sided die increases the odds of a cursed result, while a many-sided die makes it less likely.

### MORE CURSES
If you want to give the cursed die more emphasis in your session, use these techniques.
- Roll a cursed die alongside abstract oracles such as _[[#ACTION|Action]]_ and _[[#THEME|Theme]]_. These tables don’t have dedicated cursed alternatives, but you can resolve a cursed result by envisioning the nature of the prompt as frightening or uncanny.
- When you Ask the Oracle and use the yes/no table to divine an answer, toss your cursed die into the mix. If you roll a curse, envision how the answer includes a dreadful twist.

*115 THE CURSED DIE*

# CORE ORACLES
When you [[4 - Moves#ASK THE ORACLE|Ask the Oracle]] about a goal, situation, or event, roll for an _[[#ACTION|Action]] below_) and _[[#THEME|Theme]]_ (next page). Together, these tables provide a verb/noun phrase.

Other oracle tables include prompts to check for an Action and Theme (shown as ▶[[#ACTION|Action]] + ▶[[#THEME|Theme]]). That’s your cue to roll on these tables and interpret the result.

If you face a cost in your travels, such as when you roll a miss as you [[4 - Moves#UNDERTAKE AN EXPEDITION|Undertake an Expedition]], the _[[#SEAFARING PERIL|Seafaring Peril]]_ (pg 128) oracle can help reveal what occurs. If you encounter good fortune, such as when you roll a strong hit with a match, the _[[#SEAFARING OPPORTUNITY|Seafaring Opportunity]]_ (page 129) table can inspire the nature of this lucky break. Check those tables instead of—or in addition to—a seafaring waypoint.

## SHIP CONTROLLING FACTION
If the first impressions of a ship don’t reveal its identity, check the table below. If a known faction commands the ship, roll or choose on your [[1 - Adevntures Among the Isles#FACTION INFLUENCE GRID|faction influence grid]] (page 50). If it is independent or aligned with an Unknown faction, use other tables such as _[[#SHIP SYMBOL|Ship Symbol]]_ and _[[#SHIP MISSION|Ship Mission]]_ to help envision its nature, allegiances, and purpose.

## COASTLINE ASPECTS
This table reveals topographic features of the nearby island coast. If you roll twice, those aspects are combined or close together. When you travel further up the shore of a sizable island, you may reroll on this table.

If a result is at odds with the _[[#TERRAIN|Terrain]]_ or _[[#VITALITY|Vitality]]_ results (see previous pages), envision how the island includes both features. For example, shoreline cliffs can surround a flat island interior, as with an ancient volcanic Caldera. Or an isolated thicket of mangroves can grow on the shores of an otherwise desolate island.

If a seaside settlement is in sight, envision how it fits among the coastline and overall island terrain.

## OVERLAND REGION
Use this table to reveal the nature of surrounding terrain on an overland expedition. Or use the _[[#TERRAIN\|island Terrain]]_ and _[[#VITALITY\|Vitality]]_ tables (page 142) to help envision the lay of the land, and pick a region from this list based on that result.

You can combine multiple regions (Jungle Highlands, for example) into an oracle array. The following pages include Region Landmark tables for each terrain type.

If you face a cost in your travels, such as when you roll a miss as you [[4 - Moves#UNDERTAKE AN EXPEDITION|Undertake an Expedition]], the _[[#OVERLAND PERIL|Overland Peril]]_ table (page 162) can help reveal what occurs. If you encounter good fortune, such as when you roll a strong hit with a match, the _[[#OVERLAND OPPORTUNITY|Overland Opportunity]]_ table (page 163) can inspire the nature of this lucky break. Check those tables instead of—or in addition to—an overland waypoint.

## CHARACTER NAME

This table provides pairs of given and family names. When choosing or rolling for a character name, select a pair or mix and match from among the options in a row. Given and family names can often be reversed, or used independently as stand-alone names.

This table also includes monikers, one to each row. Not all characters have monikers, but sailors are often given a nickname by their shipmates, or adopt one of their own. Monikers can be used as a stand-alone name (for example, “Redbeard” or “Stormcrow”) or paired with a given name or family name (“Crimson Jack” or “Hardtack Hobbs”). Roll or select an appropriate moniker as you like.

If you are revealing a moniker for a character with a dreadful, ill-fated, mechanical, or eldritch aspect, use the _[[#[skull] CURSED MONKIER|Cursed Moniker]]_ table on page 197.

## SUMMARY: EXPLORING A SHIPWRECK
Rather than detailing every space within a wreck, focus on the key moments of what you discover and what threats or obstacles you must overcome.

### MAKING PREPARATORY MOVES
The nature of a wreck might suggest preparatory actions. For example, you might [[4 - MovesFACE DANGER|Face Danger]] to climb to a wreck that is precariously perched atop a rocky islet, or to safely navigate the interior of a flooded wreck.

### EXPLORING A WRECK
If you divert to search a shipwreck in the midst of an expedition, make the [[4 - Moves#EXPLORE A WAYPOINT|Explore a Waypoint]]. Per the move, a strong hit is an opportunity, a weak hit is an opportunity bound up with a peril, and a miss is an immediate hardship or threat. Use the _[[#SHIPWRECK OPPORTUNITY|Shipwreck Opportunity]]_ (page 203) and _[[#SHIPWRECK PERIL|Shipwreck Peril]]_ (page 203) tables to help envision those outcomes.

A strong hit with a match or a miss with a match as you [[4 - Moves#EXPLORE A WAYPOINT|Explore a Waypoint]] can trigger the [[4 - Moves#MAKE A DISCOVERY|Make a Discovery]] or [[4 - Moves#CONFRONT CHAOS|Confront Chaos]], respectively. Use the tables within those moves to envision what you find. These aredramatic, story-changing moments.

### INVESTIGATING A WRECK
If you investigate a shipwreck for clues related to a quest, make the [[4 - Moves#GATHER INFORMATION|Gather Information]]. Use the outcome of the move to help guide the nature of what you uncover—whether that discovery is favorable or unfavorable. For inspiration, use the _[[#STORY CLUE|Story Clue]]_ table (page 231).

### SCAVENGING A WRECK
If you seek to scavenge a shipwreck, make the Resupply move. On a strong hit, you are successful. A strong hit with a match might offer an opportunity (in addition to the supplies), while a weak hit or miss can reveal a peril.

### MORE DETAILS
Use the _[[#SHIPWRECK DETAILS|Shipwreck Details]]_ table (page 202) to reveal other aspects of the site.

*201 SHIPWRECK ORACLES*

## SHIPWRECK DETAILS
Use this table to reveal details of a wreck. Roll once or twice when searching a small ship, and up to three times when surveying a large vessel. These details are revealed in the context of another move—such as [[4 - Moves#EXPLORE A WAYPOINT|Explore a Waypoint]] or [[4 - Moves#GATHER INFORMATION|Gather Information]]—but might prompt additional actions or investigations. [[#SUMMARY EXPLORING A SHIPWRECK|See page 201]] for details on searching a wreck.

*205 CAVE ORACLES*

## SUMMARY: EXPLORING A CAVE
Use the exploration moves ([page 242]) when you delve a notable cave and want to give it focus in your story.

In the twisting waterways of a sea cave ([[#^Sea-Cave-Details|pages 208–209]]), you likely travel by boat through a world of tide, rock, and shadow. You may be forced to portage over shallows and high ground, or even abandon your boat as you struggle through tight spaces or desperately navigate completely flooded tunnels.

In an inland cave ([[#^Inland-Cave-Details|pages 210–211]]), you follow labyrinthine paths along claustrophobic tunnels and through cavernous chambers. Envision the oppressive weight of the stone around you, the impenetrable darkness, the unnerving echoes. 

Use the _Features_ table to inspire the details of a waypoint, the _Peril_ table when you face a cost in your travels, and the _Opportunity_ table if you encounter good fortune. But remember these tables are only a complement to your own storytelling choices.

### LURKING THREATS
Time is your enemy within a cave. To emphasize the growing tension of underground expeditions, add a tension clock for a lurking threat. When you suffer a cost through failure, delay, or inaction, you can advance the clock to show the threat drawing closer. Learn more about tension clocks on [[SF_CH3_Clocks_Tension|page 238]] of the _Starforged_ rulebook].

The table on the next page includes inspiration for lurking threats, including what signs you encounter as the tension clock advances, and what occurs when the clock fills.

### REACHING THE HEART
The heart of a cave is the epicenter of an underground domain. If you are on an expedition without a specific mission, the heart can serve as your destination. If you are seeking to make progress in a quest, what lies at the heart gives context to the final challenges or opportunities you uncover when the expedition is done.

When you [[4 - Moves#FINISH AN EXPEDITION|Finish An Expedition]], envision what lies at the cave’s heart, or use the table included with each cave type for inspiration. Once you reach a cave’s heart and resolve the expedition, you can [[4 - Moves#SET A COURSE|Set a Course]] to shortcut your exit.

## SUMMARY: EXPLORING A RUIN
Use the [[4 - Moves#^Exploration-Moves|exploration moves]] (page 242) to investigate a notable ruin. If you are diverting from an overland or seafaring expedition to check out a ruin of minor scale, you can [[4 - Moves#EXPLORE A WAYPOINT|Explore a Waypoint]] to resolve the survey with a single move. For a larger ruin, give it a challenge rank as you begin a new expedition. Then, within a ruin, use the _[[#RUIN FEATURES|Features]]_ table to inspire the details of a waypoint, the _[[#RUIN PERIL|Peril]]_ table when you face a cost, and the _[[#RUIN OPPORTUNITY|Opportunity]]_ table if you encounter good fortune.

### UNCOVERING MYSTERIES WITHIN RUINS
You do not delve into ruins to loot and defile. Instead, you seek to learn more about the people who once inhabited a site and the fate that befell them. To that end, your progress on an expedition doesn’t just represent the physical spaces you traverse. Marking progress also signifies your deepening understanding of that place’s legacy.

To explore the secrets of a mysterious ruin, follow this procedure.
- When you first mark progress within a ruin, envision a mystery that reveals itself, a question that prompts further investigation. Check the _[[#RUIN MYSTERY|Ruin Mystery]]_ table on page 216 for inspiration, or simply decide the mystery based on whatever quest or circumstance drew you to this site.
- After that, as you reach a waypoint and mark progress, you can envision uncovering a cipher—a feature, object, or encounter that delivers a new clue. Use the _[[#RUIN CIPHER|Ruin Cipher]]_ table (page 216) for inspiration of what form it takes. For details of the clue itself, [[4 - Moves#ASK THE ORACLE|Ask the Oracle]] yes/no questions, use _[[#CORE ORACLES|Core Oracles]]_ (pages 116–119) for an abstract prompt, or check the _[[#STORY CLUE|Story Clue]]_ table (page 231). If the nature of the cipher is complex or inscrutable, such as a puzzle or cryptic message, make appropriate moves to reveal or understand the clue. Envision how the clue fits into the evolving nature of the mystery, while leaving unanswered questions.
- When you prepare to [[4 - Moves#FINISH A SCENE|Finish a Scene]], consider the nature of the mystery and the clues you have uncovered, and propose a solution. The outcome of the progress roll as you [[4 - Moves#FINISH A SCENE|Finish a Scene]] reveals whether your assumptions are correct, or if you have been led astray.

## TOKENS
A token is an item of personal significance—such as a memento, heirloom, or individual treasure. Use this table when prompted by another table, or to add detail to a character. A token might have intrinsic value, but is often a thing of worth only to its owner. Not all treasures are silver and gold.

## SHIP DAMAGE
Use this table to help envision the nature of damage to your ship or impact on your crew. Use this in dramatic situations, such as suffering a miss with a match in a naval fight, or rolling a miss to [[4 - Moves#WITHSTAND DAMAGE|Withstand Damage]]. The result will introduce complications and looming catastrophes that must be dealt with.

For an initial hit, make the issue bothersome, and roll to learn what aspect of your ship is impacted. Then, if you don’t address the problem or suffer another hard hit, step up the severity. For example, a weakened mast is splintering, or a shaken crew is breaking. You should treat critical damage separately from your ship’s general integrity, requiring the “repair any other component or device” option in the [[4 - Moves#REPAIR|Repair]] move.

You can also roll on this table to reveal damage on a ship other than your own, such as when boarding a vessel after a fierce battle. If so, let your oracle roll serve double-duty by also indicating the severity. Assume the damage is bothersome on an odd roll, bad on an even roll, and critical if you roll a number divisible by 10 (10, 20, 30…).

| Roll | Bothersome Damage | Bad Damage | Critical Damage |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |

| 11 - 20 | Minor casualties | Severe casualties | Horrible casualties |
| 21 - 30 | Tangled rigging | Fraying rigging | Broken rigging |
| 31 - 40 | Weakened mast | Splintering mast | Broken mast |
| 41 - 50 | Fouled sail | Torn sail | Mangled sail |
| 51 - 55 | Damaged rudder | Jammed rudder | Broken rudder |

| 66 - 75 | Swamped deck | Flooded bilge | Keeling over |
| 76 - 80 | Dismounted cannons | Damaged cannons | Destroyed cannons |

| 96 - 100 | Roll twice; if the same result, step up the severity |  |
