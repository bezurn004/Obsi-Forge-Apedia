_Spruce up the **aspects** and **observations** of the Island as your learn more of its nature._

## Oracle: Island Coastal Aspects
> [!mechanics]- | Roll > `dice: [[SI_CH3_Island_Surroundings#^table-OclIslandCoastalAspects]]` | Guidance
> This table reveals topographic features of the nearby island coast. If you roll twice, those aspects are combined or close together. When you travel further up the shore of a sizable island, you may reroll on this table.
> 
> If a result is at odds with the _[[SI_CH3_Island_Landscape#Oracle Island Terrain|Terrain]]_ or _[[SI_CH3_Island_Landscape#Oracle Island Vitality|Vitality]]_ results (see previous pages), envision how the island includes both features. For example, shoreline cliffs can surround a flat island interior, as with an ancient volcanic Caldera. Or an isolated thicket of mangroves can grow on the shores of an otherwise desolate island.
> 
> If a seaside settlement is in sight, envision how it fits among the coastline and overall island terrain. ^guidance-OclIslandCoastalAspects
