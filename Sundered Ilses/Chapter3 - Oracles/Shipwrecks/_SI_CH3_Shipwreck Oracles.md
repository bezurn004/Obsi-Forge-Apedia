## SUMMARY: EXPLORING A SHIPWRECK
Rather than detailing every space within a wreck, focus on the key moments of what you discover and what threats or obstacles you must overcome.

### MAKING PREPARATORY MOVES
The nature of a wreck might suggest preparatory actions. For example, you might [[SI_CH4_Face Danger#Face Danger Move Card|Face Danger]] to climb to a wreck that is precariously perched atop a rocky islet, or to safely navigate the interior of a flooded wreck.

### EXPLORING A WRECK
If you divert to search a shipwreck in the midst of an expedition, make the [[SI_CH4_Explore a Waypoint#Explore a Waypoint Move Card|Explore a Waypoint]]. Per the move, a strong hit is an opportunity, a weak hit is an opportunity bound up with a peril, and a miss is an immediate hardship or threat. Use the _[[SI_CH3_Shipwreck_Fortunes#Oracle Shipwreck Opportunity|Shipwreck Opportunity]]_ (page 203) and _[[SI_CH3_Shipwreck_Fortunes#Oracle Shipwreck Peril|Shipwreck Peril]]_ (page 203) tables to help envision those outcomes.

A strong hit with a match or a miss with a match as you [[SI_CH4_Explore a Waypoint#Explore a Waypoint Move Card|Explore a Waypoint]] can trigger the [[SI_CH4_Make a Discovery|Make a Discovery]] or [[SI_CH4_Confront Chaos#Confront Chaoes Move Card|Confront Chaoes]], respectively. Use the tables within those moves to envision what you find. These aredramatic, story-changing moments.

### INVESTIGATING A WRECK
If you investigate a shipwreck for clues related to a quest, make the [[SI_CH4_Gather Information#Gather Information Move Card|Gather Information]]. Use the outcome of the move to help guide the nature of what you uncover—whether that discovery is favorable or unfavorable. For inspiration, use the _[[SI_CH3_Misc_Story#Oracle Story Clue|Story Clue]]_ table (page 231).

### SCAVENGING A WRECK
If you seek to scavenge a shipwreck, make the Resupply move. On a strong hit, you are successful. A strong hit with a match might offer an opportunity (in addition to the supplies), while a weak hit or miss can reveal a peril.

### MORE DETAILS
Use the _[[SI_CH3_Shipreck_Approach#Oracle Shipwreck Details|Shipwreck Details]]_ table (page 202) to reveal other aspects of the site.
