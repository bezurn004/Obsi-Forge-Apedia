## Description
Sky roosts are massive creatures that drift in the buoyant upper atmosphere of a Jovian world. Their broad, scalloped mantle unfurls to catch updrafts as sinuous feelers extract water, minerals, and organisms from the dense cloud layers below.

A roost’s wide cap and warm, glowing core shelters a complex ecosystem of other lifeforms. A few of these resident creatures live out their entire lives within the refuge of a single roost; others come and go as they hunt within the Jovian skies or migrate among distant habitats.

Roosts are enormous and long-lived, but fragile. In a symbiotic trade for shelter, the inhabitants provide protection against large predators and other threats, and their discarded food and waste help fuel the roost’s sluggish metabolism.

As a roost navigates the currents and eddies of the Jovian atmosphere, the expansion and contraction of its internal air bladders is heard as a deep, resounding call. As other roosts respond, the shared, plaintive song reverberates among the clouds.

When a roost is threatened, the symbiotic lifeforms it shelters mobilize to protect their home. The compulsion to defend the roost is so strong that the swarm’s instinct for self preservation is suppressed. They attack in a fierce cyclone of wing, teeth, and claw.

### Quest Starter
> Sky roosts are dying. A disease is spreading among them, threatening the delicate ecosystem of their world. What human operations do you suspect lie at the heart of this sickness? ^QuestStarter
