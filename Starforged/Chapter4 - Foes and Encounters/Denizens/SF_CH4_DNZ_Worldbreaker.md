## Description
The scale and strength of the worldbreakers is so beyond our reckoning that some consider them godlike beings. Capable of thriving on verdant jungle worlds, frozen planets, worlds scorched by volcanic activity, and even within barren asteroids in the vacuum of space, these worms possess a wisdom and a cunning that makes them a deadly threat for even the most competent spacer.

Worldbreakers range in size from about the size of a cargo hauler to an unfathomable scale that dwarfs our largest starship. They bore tunnels to pursue their prey, and hibernate in those dark depths to conserve energy. Though blind, worldbreaker worms can detect even the subtlest of footfalls, and they follow these vibrations to eventually consume their quarry—along with any other creatures, starships, or structures that happen to be nearby.

## Variants
### Variant: Worldbreaker Brood

| **Rank: Formidable** | ![[hex-checkedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-checkedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-checkedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-uncheckedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-uncheckedG.svg\|15]] |

The young of the worldbreakers are a fraction of the size of their older counterparts, yet still dwarf most humans, and boast a voracious appetite. Unlike their solitary parents, immature worms hunt in small packs, working together to burrow beneath easy prey.

### Variant: Elder Worm

Elder worms, those centuries or even millennia old, are the largest and most formidable of the worldbreakers, and yet the least aggressive. They follow inscrutable whims, live in harmony with surrounding flora and fauna, and only hunt when absolutely necessary.

### Quest Starter
> On a lush world at the edge of the Terminus, a titanic worldbreaker worm holds sway. One faction seeks to destroy the worm so that the riches of this place can be harvested. Another swears to protect it. On which side do you fall? ^QuestStarter
