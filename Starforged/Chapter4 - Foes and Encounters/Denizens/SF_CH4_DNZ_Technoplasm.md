## Description
Theorized to be a precursor bioweapon that persisted long beyond the death of its creators, technoplasm is a malignant lifeform that infects, mutates, and controls machines, robots, and computer systems.

Technoplasm infestations are tenacious, cunning, and dangerous to eliminate. When in doubt, burn it and deal with the aftermath that comes with generous applications of fire. A ship or settlement with a large outbreak is likely too far gone and best abandoned, although some suggest every infection has its source; if you somehow find and destroy the heart of a technoplasm infestation, can you kill it entirely?

## Variants
### Variant: Infected Bot

When bots fall prey to technoplasm outbreaks, they are transformed into horrific amalgams of machine and living proto-ooze. Once subsumed, they set out to serve the primitive impulses of the infection, defending affected sites and finding new machines to corrupt.

### Variant: Scourge Ship (Vehicle)

| --- | --- |
| **Rank: Extreme** | ![[hex-checkedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-checkedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-checkedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-checkedG.svg\|15]] ![[hex-uncheckedG.svg\|15]] |

These corrupted vessels, their crews long-dead, their hulls wracked by creeping slime and grasping pseudopods, prowl the depths of the Forge in search of new ships and stations to infect. Inside, the gelatinous mass of the technoplasm slithers through darkened corridors. Tendrils of the ooze bore into bulkheads and machinery like marbleized fat through a chunk of meat.

### Quest Starter
> An outcast cult believes technoplasm is the ultimate synthesis of machine and flesh. They are plotting to unleash it upon populated space. What decisive first strike have they set in motion, and how do you learn of their scheme? ^QuestStarter
