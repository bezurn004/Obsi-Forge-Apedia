## Description
Ghosts are undead spirits held in the boundary of life and death by forces beyond our knowing. These restless phantasms may be tied to a location, an object, or even a person.

Their form and nature varies. Some ghosts seek absolution. Others want revenge. Many are so sundered by a traumatic or unjust death that only a tormented, destructive shell of their former selves remain.

Ghosts might manifest in a physical form or assault with physical force, but they cannot be defeated through violence. To vanquish a ghost, you must instead find the key to unshackle them from our reality.

These forsaken ships cruise through the depths of the Forge, carried by relentless inertia. They are dark and cold, and might initially seem a lucky find to a scavenger or pirate. But those who dare to trespass within these haunted vessels are not alone, and the tormented inhabitants will soon make themselves known.
