# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: More Oracle Options
### Oracle Arrays
Starforged oracles offer many options for answering questions and generating locations and encounters. But these options can slow down your gameplay as you consider what table to use for a specific situation.

Don’t get overwhelmed. You’ll soon develop your own preferences. Plus, using established facts and your intuition without needing to Ask the Oracle will keep things moving. But if you want to play with all the toys in the oracle toybox, while leaving some of the moment-to-moment decisions in the hands of fate, an oracle array is your answer.

An oracle array is a collection of oracles you assemble to help answer questions for a specific situation or location.

The key to an oracle array is your six-sided action die. To create an array, you’ll assign the values of that die (1–6) to two or more oracle tables. When you need inspiration for a situation or location associated with an array, roll your action die alongside your oracle dice. This magically transforms your action die into an array die for the purposes of this roll. Check the value of the array die to see what table you’ll reference.

Arrays are an optional tool, but mixing and matching oracle tables within an array will arm you with a rich collection of possibilities. A simple ad-hoc array can be quickly created while making an oracle roll. More complex arrays for a site or situation can be outlined in your journal or on a note card for repeated use.


| Action Die | Exploring the Haunted Derelict |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Haunted Feature |
| 2-5 | Derelict Feature |
| 6 | Descriptor + Focus |


| Action Die | Trouble in the Haunted Derelict |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Pay the Price |
| 2-3 | Haunted Peril |
| 4-5 | Derelict Peril |
| 6 | Story Complication |

> [!cite] Narrative Example
> You’ve traveled to an orbital outpost, and roll a weak hit as you Finish an Expedition. Per that move, you must suffer a complication at the end of the journey. You aren’t sure how to resolve this new trouble, so you consider what oracle table to use for inspiration. The Story Complication oracle would be a good fit. Or you could assign this settlement the Inhabited theme and roll on the Inhabited Peril table. You decide to leave it in the hands of fate with an impromptu oracle array. On a 1–4, you’ll use the Story Complication oracle. On a 5–6, it’ll be an Inhabited Peril. You roll the 6-sided array die alongside the oracle dice. It comes up as a 5, so you check the value of the oracle dice against the Inhabited Peril table.

### Fill in the Blanks
A final option for structuring oracle prompts is to construct sentences or phrases with blanks for oracle answers. Creating these mad libs and interpreting their meaning can be a fun creative exercise to help kickoff or energize a campaign.

For example, here’s an oracle mad lib for a sworn quest.

> <font size=4>I swear to ==[[SF_CH5_Core_Action-Theme#Oracle Action|Action]]== a ==[[SF_CH5_Core_Action-Theme#Oracle Theme|Theme]]==<br>of a ==[[SF_CH5_Core_Descriptor-Focus#Oracle Descriptor|Descriptor]]== ==[[SF_CH5_Core_Descriptor-Focus#Oracle Focus|Focus]]== <br>located in ==[[SF_CH5_Sector-Name#Oracle Sector Name Prefix and Suffix|Sector Name]]==.<br>I am opposed by ==[[SF_CH5_Character-Names|Character Name]]==,<br>a ==[[SF_CH5_Character-Drives#Oracle Character Role|Character Role]]== who<br>wants to ==[[SF_CH5_Character-Drives#Oracle Character Goal|Character Goal]]==.  </font>
