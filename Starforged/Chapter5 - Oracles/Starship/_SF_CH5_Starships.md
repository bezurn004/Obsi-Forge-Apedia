If this is a **Fleet** of starships, then learn their general class (type) composition for their mission. Then if desired, give the starship a **Name** to reference in your story._

Once you learn first hand, or by other means, you could choose to give the starship a **Mission**, which could also be used as a start of a spaceborne quest._

## Campaign Oracles
If you wish to provide very deep interaction with a Starship not of your own, you can make use of the Starship personality tables provided in Character Creation.
> [!example]- Starship History
> ![[SF_CH2_Board Your Starship#Giving The Starship a History]]

> [!example]- Starship Quirks
> ![[SF_CH2_Board Your Starship#Envision The Starship]]
