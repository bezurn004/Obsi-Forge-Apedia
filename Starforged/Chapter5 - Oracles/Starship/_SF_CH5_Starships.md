# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: Starships
As you come across other starship vessels in your journey's through the Forge, use the Starship Oracles to inspire the narrative of those encounters. 

## [[SF_CH5_Starship-Creation|Starship Type Oracle]]
To begin creating a starship from scratch, start with this page which contains the **Type** of starship you encounter. If this is a **Fleet** of starships, then learn their general class (type) composition for their mission. Then if desired, give the starship a **Name** to reference in your story.

## [[SF_CH5_Starship-Approach#|Starship Approach]]
As you approach a starship start with either making **Initial Contact** or envisioning its **First Look** as your initial perception of the craft. Once you learn first hand, or by other means, you could choose to give the starship a **Mission**, which could also be used as a start of a spaceborne quest.

## [[SF_CH5_Starship-Name|Starship Name Oracle]]
When a starship will have significance in your story, choose or roll for its **Name**


## Campaign Oracles
If you wish to provide very deep interaction with a Starship not of your own, you can make use of the Starship personality tables provided in Character Creation.
