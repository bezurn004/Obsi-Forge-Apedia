*370 CHAPTER 5: ORACLES*

## Summary: Exploring Location Theme Locations
Themes help you envision atmosphere, features, and encounters within an unusual, aberrant, or important location. Each theme on the following pages includes a set of oracles. 

Use these oracles to...
- **Feature:** Reveal a new aspect of the location. 
- **Peril:** Help envision a complication or hazard. 
- **Opportunity:** Help envision a beneficial encounter or event, such as when rolling a strong hit with a match in a location.

You can answer questions about a place using only the tables provided for a theme, such as when delving into an Infested cave. Or pair a theme with other location oracles for more flavor and variety; for example, you might explore a Haunted Grave World, a Ruined Derelict, a Sacred Precursor Vault, or an Inhabited Settlement.

When mixing-and-matching a theme with another set of tables, use the techniques described for an oracle array (page 384) to determine which oracle you reference for that question or phase of your exploration.
