# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: Precursor Vaults
These are the order of oracles to utilize when uncovering an eneigmatic precursor vault.

## [[SF_CH5_Vault-Exterior|Precursor Vault Exterior Oracles]]
Start here to choose from these oracles for various characteristics of the precursor vault.
- **Location**: Where the vault is located
- **Scale**: How large the vault is, likely impacting the rank of any expedition
- **Form**: Type of site this vault conforms to.
- **Shape**: Primary geometric shape of the vault.
- **Material**: General composition of the vault.
- **Outer First Look**: Initial aspect that surrounds the vault.

## [[SF_CH5_Vault-Interior|Precursor Vault Interior Oracle]]
Similar to a derelict site, precursor vaults can be explored when you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]]. Start with a **First Look**, of the initial entry and then occasionally choose various **Feature**. When your fortunes are bad, generate a **Peril** and take advantage of the **Opportunities** when they turn up.

## [[SF_CH5_Vault-Sanctum|Vault Sanctum Oracle]]
Once narratively appropriate, or you have filled in 6 boxes on the progress track of your expedition, you transition to the Sanctum. Continue the journey with new **Features** to ultimately learn the **Sanctum Purpose**. When your fortunes are bad, generate a **Peril** and take advantage of the **Opportunities** when they turn up.

## Summary: Exploring Precursor Vaults
When you first come upon a vault, use the tables on the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Exterior|Vault Creation Oracle]] to help envision its form and nature. For a more abstract prompt, just use the [[SF_CH5_Core_Descriptor-Focus#Oracle Descriptor|Descriptor/Focus Oracle]]. In either case—if that’s enough detail for the role of the vault in your story, stop there. 

### Detailed Precursor Vault Generation
If the survey of a vault is a focus for your current quest, use the oracle tables in this section to generate a more complete picture of the site. ==See the next page for a diagram of the three main phases of exploration.== #missingArt 
 - ==Exterior==: Start by generating the basic form and characteristics of the vault using [[SF_CH5_Vault-Exterior|Vault Creation]] oracles. These features represent what you observe from a safe distance. 
 - ==Interior==: If you enter the site, check the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Interior#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Interior First Look|Inner First Look]] oracle for initial impressions of what lies within. If you explore further, use the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Interior#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Interior Feature|Interior Feature]] oracle to define what you find or encounter. If you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] within a vault, check this oracle if you want help setting the scene for a waypoint. 
 - ==Sanctum==: As you delve deeper into a vault, the corruption and strangeness of the place takes hold. Use the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Sanctum#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Sanctum Feature|Sanctum Feature]] oracle to represent the aberrant nature of a vault’s depths. 

### Delving the Sanctum
Your passage from the Interior into the Sanctum is triggered by a rolled result on the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Interior#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Interior Feature|Interior Feature]] oracle: **“Transition into the Sanctum.”**

If you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] into a vault, you can also use the progress track as a gauge for your current location. Once you reach six or more filled progress boxes, you have reached the Sanctum.

If you envision a vault as particularly strange and perilous, use the Sanctum as the framing for the entirety of your exploration. If it is relatively mundane, use only the Interior.

### Revealing the Vault's Purpose
If the original function of the vault is a mystery, use the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Sanctum#Oracle Precursor Vault Purpose]] oracle to see what lies at its heart. Check this oracle when your story leads to a reveal of the site’s true nature, such as when you [[SF_CH3_Finish an Expedition|Finish an Expedition (move)]].

### Perils and Opportunities
Use these oracles to help envision a complication or favorable circumstance within a vault, such as when you [[SF_CH3_Explore a Waypoint|Explore a Waypoint (move)]] and are prompted to envision a peril or opportunity.
