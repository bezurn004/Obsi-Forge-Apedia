# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: Precursor Vaults
_When uncovering an enigmatic precursor vault, these oracles will guide you to their secrets._

## Summary: Exploring Precursor Vaults
When you first come upon a vault, use the tables on the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Exterior|Vault Creation Oracle]] to help envision its form and nature. For a more abstract prompt, just use the [[SF_CH5_Core_Descriptor-Focus#Oracle Descriptor|Descriptor/Focus Oracle]]. In either case—if that’s enough detail for the role of the vault in your story, stop there. 

### Detailed Precursor Vault Generation
If the survey of a vault is a focus for your current quest, use the oracle tables in this section to generate a more complete picture of the site. ==See the next page for a diagram of the three main phases of exploration.== #missingArt 
 - ==Exterior==: Start by generating the basic form and characteristics of the vault using [[SF_CH5_Vault-Exterior|Vault Creation]] oracles. These features represent what you observe from a safe distance. 
 - ==Interior==: If you enter the site, check the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Interior#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Interior First Look|Inner First Look]] oracle for initial impressions of what lies within. If you explore further, use the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Interior#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Interior Feature|Interior Feature]] oracle to define what you find or encounter. If you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] within a vault, check this oracle if you want help setting the scene for a waypoint. 
 - ==Sanctum==: As you delve deeper into a vault, the corruption and strangeness of the place takes hold. Use the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Sanctum#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Sanctum Feature|Sanctum Feature]] oracle to represent the aberrant nature of a vault’s depths. 

### Delving the Sanctum
Your passage from the Interior into the Sanctum is triggered by a rolled result on the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Interior#Oracle: Precursor Vault: Interior Feature|Interior Feature]] oracle: **“Transition into the Sanctum.”**

If you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition]] into a vault, you can also use the progress track as a gauge for your current location. Once you reach six or more filled progress boxes, you have reached the Sanctum.

If you envision a vault as particularly strange and perilous, use the Sanctum as the framing for the entirety of your exploration. If it is relatively mundane, use only the Interior.

### Revealing the Vault's Purpose
If the original function of the vault is a mystery, use the [[SF_CH5_Vault-Sanctum#Oracle Precursor Vault Purpose]] oracle to see what lies at its heart. Check this oracle when your story leads to a reveal of the site’s true nature, such as when you [[SF_CH3_Finish an Expedition|Finish an Expedition]].

### Perils and Opportunities
Use these oracles to help envision a complication or favorable circumstance within a vault, such as when you [[SF_CH3_Explore a Waypoint|Explore a Waypoint (move)]] and are prompted to envision a peril or opportunity.
