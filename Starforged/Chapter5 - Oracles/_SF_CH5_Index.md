## Grouped Oracle Pages
Individual Oracles are usually grouped by purpose. See the table for general guidance for understanding these groupings.

- **Approach** As the adventurers draw closer to the subject, peel the onion to gather the First Looks and more clarifying characteristics
- **Creation** Oracles that are used to get a baseline understanding of a subject. Usually where it is located, region, scale
- **Fortunes** The Perils and Opportunities for various locations to use during expeditions
- **Name** Various naming Oracles that can be given to a subject either on creation, or waiting until more is known before it is revealed
- **Drives/Concerns** The name varies by type of entity, these pages contain usually the more detailed knowledge that would require in-depth understanding before learning.
