# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: Core
The following pages include a set of four ==Core Oracles== that are central to _Starforged_. They are: ==Action==, ==Theme==, ==Descriptor==, and ==Focus==. Each includes 100 single-word results as abstract prompts.

You can roll on these tables individually or combine them with results from other oracles. In most cases, you’ll roll on a set of two oracles, Action and Theme or Descriptor and Focus, to form a simple sentence out of a word pair. Then, interpret the result based on the context of the question and your current situation. If a result doesn’t fit, check adjacent rows or roll again.

The Core Oracles provide creative prompts suitable for many situations. In fact, for a lightweight approach, it’s possible to ignore the other oracles and focus on answering questions using only the [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]] and these four tables.

## [[SF_CH5_Core_Action-Theme|Action/Theme Oracle]]
Use these oracle tables to reveal details about a goal, situation, or event. They provide a word or phrase that can be taken literally or interpreted as an abstraction.

Action and Theme can answer questions such as:
- “What does this character want?”
- “What is this faction’s mission?”
- “What caused the downfall of this settlement?”
- “What is this device’s purpose?” 

## [[SF_CH5_Core_Descriptor-Focus|Descriptor/Focus Oracle]]
Use these oracles to generate the details of a location, discovery, or encounter. The Descriptor oracle is particularly handy for quick generation of a location. For example, use it to describe the basic nature of a planet instead of rolling on the detailed planet oracles.

Descriptor and Focus can answer questions such as:
- “What is this ship’s cargo?”
- “What is the nature of this planet?”
- “What is inside this station?”
- “What hazard do I encounter?”
