# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]] - [[_SF_CH5_Core|Core]]: Descriptor and Focus
Use these oracles to generate the details of a location, discovery, or encounter. The Descriptor oracle is particularly handy for quick generation of a location. For example, use it to describe the basic nature of a planet instead of rolling on the detailed planet oracles.

Descriptor and Focus can answer questions such as:
- “What is this ship’s cargo?”
- “What is the nature of this planet?”
- “What is inside this station?”
- “What hazard do I encounter?”

> When you [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] to help define the nature of a location, discovery, or encounter, roll for a Descriptor and a Focus for an adjective/noun prompt. Other oracles will include prompts to check for a Descriptor and Focus (shown as “Descriptor + Focus”). That’s your cue to roll on these tables and interpret the result as appropriate to the situation. ^guidance-OclDescriptior-Focus
