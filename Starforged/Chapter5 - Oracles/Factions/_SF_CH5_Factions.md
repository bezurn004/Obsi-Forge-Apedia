# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: Factions
Factions add scale and narrative opportunities to your setting. But keep it manageable. Don’t overload your campaign with factions. Instead, focus on your interactions and entanglements with members of a few interesting factions. To get started generating factions, use the below oracles.

> _As part of the creation process (either first or second), choose a name for a faction using the **Name Template**. This template has three main components. Usually the name and type of faction is enough to introduce it into your setting._

> _After first introducing a faction into the setting, start to reveal deeper aspects of the organization's personality._

As more factions are introduce, begin to weave the **Relationships** between each of the groups. As you converse and learn more from your adventures, discover **Rumors** related to factions that could lead to further storylines._
