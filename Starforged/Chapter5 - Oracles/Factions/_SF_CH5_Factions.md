# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: Factions
Factions add scale and narrative opportunities to your setting. But keep it manageable. Don’t overload your campaign with factions. Instead, focus on your interactions and entanglements with members of a few interesting factions. To get started generating factions, use the below oracles.

## [[SF_CH5_Faction-Types|Faction Types Oracle]]
Factions are a collection of people throughout the Forge working towards shared aspirations. There are three primary **Types**:
- **Dominions**: Strive to hold authority over settlements and sectors of the Forge.
- **Guilds**: Work to enrich both their members and humanity through the specialized field they have mastered.
- **Fringe Groups**: Seek to upset the natural order of society often in unscrupulous means.
- **Leadership**: Primarily for use of Dominion faction types, but could be used for others if desired.

## [[SF_CH5_Faction-Name|Faction Name Oracle]]
As part of the creation process (either first or second), choose a name for a faction using the **Name Template**. This template has three main components.
- **Legacy**: Invokes the aspiration of the faction's ideals.
- **Affiliation**: How to faction is loosely grouped or ordered.
- **Identity**: A theme or mascot that conveys the impact they wish to portray.
Usually the name and type of faction is enough to introduce it into your setting.

## [[SF_CH5_Faction-Motives|Faction Motives Oracle]]
After first introducing a faction into the setting, start to reveal deeper aspects of the organization's personality.
- **Projects** - Goals to achieve to further the faction's ambitions.
- **Quriks** - Usual aspects of members of the faction that sets them apart from others.

## [[SF_CH5_Faction-Relations|Faction Relations Oracle]]
Envision how prevalent and powerful a faction is through the **Influence** they hold in the Forge. As more factions are introduce, begin to weave the **Relationships** between each of the groups. As you converse and learn more from your adventures, discover **Rumors** related to factions that could lead to further storylines.
