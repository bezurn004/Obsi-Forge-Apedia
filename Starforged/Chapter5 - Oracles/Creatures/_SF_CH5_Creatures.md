# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracle]]: Creatures
When you encounter an unknown lifeform, build it with these oracles.

## [[SF_CH5_Creature-Environment-Scale|Creature Environment and Scale Oracle]]
If the **Environment** of its natural habitat is not known, then choose for that first. Determine its **Scale** which may effect the rank you assign should hostilities arise.

## [[SF_CH5_Creature-Basic Form|Creature Basic Form Oracle]]
Based on its environment from the first step, choose its **Basic Form** of the creature's body.

## [[SF_CH5_Creature-Approach|Creature Approach Oracle]]
As you begin to interact with the creature get a sense of its **First Look** and how it reacts with an **Encountered Behavior**. Once you spend more time in either observation or conflict, determine a **Revealed Aspect** as you gain deeper understanding of its nature and abilities.
