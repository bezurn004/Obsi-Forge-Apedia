## CONTENT AND SAFETY
_Ironsworn: Starforged_ is a tabletop roleplaying game of science fiction exploration and adventure. It includes themes of suspense, supernatural horror, action-oriented violence, warfare, natural and man-made disasters, and resource scarcity. In addition, the random and abstract nature of oracle tables included in _Starforged_ may prompt interpretations involving sensitive subjects that aren’t explicitly included in the game.

Safety tools are recommended. Starforged includes integrated [[_SF_CH3_Session Moves|Session Moves]] (page 140) to help focus on consent, collaboration, and prioritizing players over the narrative
