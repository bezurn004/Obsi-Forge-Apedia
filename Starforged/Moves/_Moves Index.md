## Exploring the Depths
In this chapter, we’ll look at _Starforged_ gameplay in more detail. In particular, you’ll find expanded information on framing and resolving the various moves in the game, along with tips and options for customizing your experience.

**Don’t read this chapter front-to-back.** Instead, if you have a question about a specific move, activity, or best-practice, go to that section. Also remember that the moves are available as printable handouts in the Starforged Playkit. Refer to those handouts during your session, and come back to this chapter if you need guidance or want more detail.

## Three Pillars of Play
Through moves, legacy rewards, and narrative prompts, _Starforged_ emphasizes three primary undertakings:  #missingArt _icons on the 3 pillar cards, mermaid is doing pretty good though!_

	1(=- Quests -=\nSwear vows and\n do what you must\n to see them fulfilled)
	2(=- Bonds -=\nCreate connections\nand build\nrelationships)
	3(=- Discoveries -=\nExplore the Forge\nand unlock\nmysteries)

The ==[[_Quest Moves|quest moves]]==, ==[[_Connection Moves|connection moves]]==, and ==[[_Exploration Moves|exploration moves]]== directly support these gameplay pillars. They are the foundation of your _Starforged_ adventures. Other moves help resolve the moment-to-moment perils and opportunities you encounter through these activities. 

If your story ever feels aimless, without any direction for your character, look to these three pillars. Take a quest. Build a relationship. Go explore. In fact, you’ll often do all three at once as your quest-bound adventures include interactions with key characters and expeditions into the hidden depths of the galaxy. 

Depending on the nature of your character and the assets you bring to bear, you may emphasize one pillar over the others—but none should be ignored. They are your touchstones for compelling, emotional, and surprising stories.
