# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|Moves]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|In Depth]]: Fate Moves
In solo and co-op play, the ==fate moves== mediate the result of other moves or serve as inspirational prompts for your story. When you face the uncertain outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question about people, places, and events, these moves help reveal the answer.

>**[[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]]**
> When you seek to resolve questions, reveal details, discover locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events…

>**[[SF_CH3_Pay the Price|Pay the Price]]**
> When you suffer the outcome of an action…

The fate moves combine your storytelling instincts with a dash of unpredictability to help resolve questions and situations. This includes three main techniques: 
- Instinct: If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting, and dramatic, make it happen. 
- Randomness: Roll on random tables to answer a specific question or to generate the details of a story element such as a person, creature, or location. 
- Inspiration: Use abstract creative prompts to help guide your story. Creative interpretation will lead you naturally from an abstract concept to a relevant answer. 

In guided mode, the guide represents the whims of fate. They can reference the fate moves and oracles as they like, but can also decide the outcome or direct questions back to the players.
