# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|In Depth]]: Exploration Moves
The Forge is a vast, chaotic, and largely unexplored galaxy. Your sworn vows will take you through uncharted space, across the surface of inhospitable planets, and into the depths of foreboding derelicts, enigmatic alien vaults, and other perilous sites. 

Will you survive these expeditions? What will they cost you? What wonders and horrors will you face? Use the ==exploration moves== to find out.

*168 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH*

## Combining Expeditions and Quests
Typically, an expedition is an obstacle to be overcome in a related quest. When you [[SF_CH3_Finish an Expedition|Finish an Expedition (move)]], you might also [[SF_CH3_Reach a Milestone|Reach a Milestone (move)]] on a vow. But what do you do when the objective of an expedition is also the focus of a vow? 

>[!cite] Narrative example
>You [[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow|Swear an Iron Vow]] to transport urgently needed medical supplies to a remote outpost. But a clan of drift pirates stalk the spaceways in this sector, and other dangers surely await in the depths of the Forge. 

In this example, the expedition destination and the object of a quest are essentially the same. However, you still maintain separate progress tracks for each. Progress on your expedition is not marked as progress on your vow; instead, you find opportunities to [[SF_CH3_Reach a Milestone|Reach a Milestone]] as you prepare, undertake, and complete the expedition. 

First, consider what obstacles you must deal with as you ready yourself for the expedition. Do you need to obtain navigational data? Are there forces that seek to prevent you from setting off? Overcoming these obstacles can allow you to [[SF_CH3_Reach a Milestone|Reach a Milestone]] in your quest. 

During the expedition, manage your progress for the expedition and the vow separately. When you successfully [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition]], mark progress on that track. In parallel, as you gain new information and overcome obstacles and foes related to the quest, you can Reach a Milestone and mark progress on your vow. 

Finally, the moment when you successfully [[SF_CH3_Finish an Expedition|Finish an Expedition]] will probably serve as a milestone in your quest. Depending on the situation, you may face obstacles at your destination that you must overcome before you can [[SF_CH3_Fullfill Your Vow|Fullfill Your Vow]]. There may be enemies protecting the objective, for example, or a hazard you must bypass. These obstacles are additional milestones in your quest. 

>[!tip]
>In fact, adding obstacles once you [[SF_CH3_Finish an Expedition|Finish an Expedition]] can accomplish two things: It creates additional milestones to fill out your vow progress track, and can make the climax of your quest and expedition more dramatic and exciting. 

If a quest is directly related to an expedition and seems relatively straightforward, you should give it an appropriately low rank, a step or two below the rank of the expedition. For example, you might have a dangerous quest to achieve an objective on a formidable expedition.
