# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|In Depth]]: Suffer Moves
When you bear the brunt of a failed action or make a concession, the ==suffer moves== help resolve the cost. These moves are typically made when you must [[SF_CH3_Pay the Price|Pay the Price]] and face a hardship that directly impacts your well-being and readiness, or as prompted by a move or asset.

The suffer moves are tied to a mechanical result, reducing the value of an associated resource (momentum, health, spirit, supply, a companion’s health, or a vehicle’s integrity) by an amount appropriate to the severity of the incident or nature of a foe. But when you apply the mechanical cost of a suffer move, don’t just move numbers around. Take a moment to envision the details in the fiction. How does the situation change? What happens next? 

Also, keep in mind that a suffer move is only one way to represent a costly outcome. Introducing complications and perils without an immediate mechanical cost will amp up the tension and danger of your story. Bring down the hammer with a suffer move to represent compounding failures, or when you want to quickly resolve a cost without giving it undue focus in your story.
