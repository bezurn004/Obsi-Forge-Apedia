# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|In Depth]]: Recover Moves
Life as an Ironsworn is not easy or comfortable. When your resources are strained, your health and spirit ebbing, your equipment and vehicles in disrepair, you’ll need to find relief from the perils of the Forge and the burdens of your sworn oaths. 

Make these ==recover moves== when you attempt to rest, recover, or refit.

>**[[SF_CH3_Sojourn|Sojourn]]**
> When you spend time recovering within a community…

>**[[SF_CH3_Heal|Heal]]**
> When you receive medical care or provide treatment…

>**[[SF_CH3_Hearten|Hearten]]**
> When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace…

>**[[SF_CH3_Resupply|Resupply]]**
> When you attempt to bolster your readiness…

>**[[SF_CH3_Repair|Repair]]**
> When you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other devices…

These moves are primarily focused on bolstering your [[SF_CH1_Condition Meters|Condition Meters (gameplay)]], including health, spirit, supply, and vehicle integrity. But the [[SF_CH3_Heal|Heal]] move is also broadly useful for giving medical aid to allies and other characters, and the [[SF_CH3_Repair|Repair]] move can be used for any machine or device.
