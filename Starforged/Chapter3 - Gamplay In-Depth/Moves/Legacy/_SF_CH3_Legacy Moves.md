# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|In Depth]]: Legacy Moves
The three legacy tracks - quests, bonds, and discoveries - are a special type of progress track to show the evolution of your character. As you fulfill vows, build relationships, and explore the Forge, you’ll mark progress on these tracks and gain experience. This experience is then spent on character assets to represent your character’s growing skills, influence, and resources.

Make these ==legacy moves== to gain and spend experience, and when you face a final test to learn how your accomplishments and failures will echo through time.
