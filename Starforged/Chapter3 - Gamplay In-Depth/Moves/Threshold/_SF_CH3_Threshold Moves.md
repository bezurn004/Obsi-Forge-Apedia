# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|Moves]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|In Depth]]: Threshold Moves
Despite your best efforts to overcome the perils of the Forge, calamitous events may bring you to the precipice of life and death, redemption and desolation, perseverance and destruction. 

In these moments you face your greatest tests. What will become of you when all seems lost? Will you see your character undone, or find yourself on a path of renewed purpose? Make these ==threshold moves== to find out.

>**[[SF_CH3_Face Death|Face Death]]**
> When you encounter a situation where death is an immediate and unavoidable outcome, or when you are brought to the brink of death with a chance for recovery or redemption…

>**[[SF_CH3_Face Desolution|Face Desolution]]**
> When you are brought to the brink of desolation…

>**[[SF_CH3_Overcome Destruction|Overcome Destruction]]**
> When your command vehicle is destroyed or irrevocably lost…

These moves are (hopefully) rarely made. They are an opportunity to upend your character’s adventures, reinforce the perils of the Forge, and deepen your story. When you make a threshold move, give it a focus. Make it dramatic and personal.
