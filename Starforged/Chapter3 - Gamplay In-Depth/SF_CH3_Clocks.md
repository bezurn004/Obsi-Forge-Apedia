# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|In Depth]]: Clocks
In _Starforged_, you are the center of your universe. Moves and progress tracks are primarily managed from your perspective. Other people, beings, and threats do not have mechanical weight, and their narrative influence is focused on how they aid or hinder your own objectives. 

But time is an unyielding force. Powers and factions are busy pursuing their own agendas. You are only one small part of a complex galaxy. 

If you want to forge a more dynamic and reactive universe, clocks might be the answer. These optional devices track the evolution of forces external to your character or the rising tension of an imminent danger. They are usually used to measure the progression of something bad happening, but can also gauge the headway of a friendly force or faction toward a project or goal. 

By default, clocks are represented by circles divided into four, six, eight, or ten segments.

#missingArt _four graphics of black and white circles; the number 4 in the middle and four segments, the number 6 in the middle and six segments, the number 8 in the middle and 8 segments, the number 10 in the middle and 10 segments.

When a clock advances, fill in a segment. Start at the 12 o’clock position, and move clockwise around the circle as you fill segments. When the clock is full, whatever problem or event it was tracking comes to fruition. 

Never erase segments—clocks are inexorable and only move forward. If a clock is no longer a factor due to your actions or because of external events, the clock stops and is removed from play. 

There are two main types of clocks,  %% #addition revamped paragraph to break into section TOC%% _with an additional section below_:

> As you undertake your sworn vows and delve the depths of the galaxy, other people, factions, and threats evolve and advance their own agendas...

> **==[[SF_CH3_Clocks_Tension|Tension Clocks]]==**
> Used to represent a looming threat or deadline in a scene, or an escalating danger that persists across scenes...

> **==[[_SF_CH3_Scene Moves|Scene Challenge]]==**
> Guidelines for a structured method of resolving tension clocks...

> Printable clocks are available as part of the _Starforged Playkit_. But you can manage clocks in whatever form is convenient. For example, draw them as a row of bubbles to be filled in, or as lines you strike a hash mark through. Or use four, six, eight, and ten-sided dice as countdown markers, rotating them to show the remaining number of segments.
