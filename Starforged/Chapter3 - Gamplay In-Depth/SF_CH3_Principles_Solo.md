## Chronicle Your Adventures
When you play _Starforged_ with other players, the shared conversation helps create a story that lives beyond the game table. When playing solo, the conversation is between you and the system. The mechanics and moves are part of that conversation, but your character and your world exist only for you.

This can make your story feel a bit fleeting. To ground your sessions and make it easier to pick up where you left off, keep a record at whatever level of detail you prefer. This can be simple bullet points in a text file, a log in a virtual tabletop, a handwritten journal filled with sketches and notes, a play report you share on a forum or blog, or even a streamed or recorded session. There’s no wrong answer. Use whatever approach is an enjoyable aspect of your play. If it feels like work, simplify.

## Ask the Oracle, but Trust Your Insticts
Oracles are a valuable tool for solo play, but don’t let them replace your own storytelling instincts. Too many oracle rolls can make a session feel like an exercise in randomness. Trust your gut. If it’s dramatic, fits the fiction, and pushes your story forward, make it happen. When you want to gloss over something, do so. Use the oracles to fill in the gaps. Keep it moving.

## Be a Fan of Your Character (Stop Hitting Yourself)
Here’s something unexpected: Solo players are hard on their characters. While a guide will moderate the severity of outcomes to keep everyone motivated and having fun, solo players often default to severe results when they suffer a cost or complication, grinding their character down through mechanical and narrative penalties. What’s more, they’ll envision these setbacks as inherent failings of the character, instead of factors out of their control.

Perhaps this is born out of a desire not to “cheat.” But you are the ultimate arbiter of your story; it’s not possible to cheat. In fact, the [[SF_CH3_Change Your Fate|Change Your Fate]] offers explicit permission to alter, redo, or ignore any fictional or mechanical outcome that is unsafe or un-fun.

The gameplay of _Starforged_ is tuned to introduce complications and adversity, so don’t be reluctant to give your character a break. Use the techniques described in the [[SF_CH3_Pay the Price|Pay the Price]] summary to balance narrative and mechanical costs. Create a sense of rising tension by escalating the danger and risk of situation, instead of hitting your character hard out of the gate. Save the dire complications and major mechanical costs for key, dramatic moments. When it matters, make it hurt. Until then, give your character space to be awesome. They’ll thank you for it.
