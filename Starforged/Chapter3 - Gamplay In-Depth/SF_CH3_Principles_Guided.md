### Facilitate, Don't Impose
You are the guide for your players as they explore the setting and the story of their characters. You set the scenes and portray the creatures and characters they encounter. When the narrative hits a lull, or someone creates an opportunity for a complication, consequence, or discovery, make something happen.

But you are a guide with an unreliable compass heading into unknown realms. Let the players choose their path. Moderate the conversation without dominating it.

### Deliver Answers and Ask Questions
The players will look to you to answer questions about the setting, portray the actions and reactions of other characters, and help determine the outcome of moves. When they do, answer their question, keeping in mind the fiction and truths you’ve established through play.

You should also look for opportunities to motivate input from others at the table. Encourage them to add details and ground every move in the fiction. Work to create a shared world and narrative that everyone has stake in. Answer questions by asking questions. If a conversation hits a dead end or drags on, take the question back, deliver an answer (or [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]]), and move on.

### Embrace Chaos
Don’t over-prepare for your session. Feel free to come to the table with nothing planned. The character-driven quests help you and the other players build a story together. Anything that is not a protagonist or move has very little mechanical detail, and can be introduced on the fly.

Letting go of your plans leaves you open to the unexpected. Cheer for surprising successes. Seize the story possibilities of dramatic failures. Forge a galaxy of wonder and danger.

You can also use the oracles for answers and inspiration. Ask a yes/no question through the [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]], or interpret a response from the oracle tables. You can even collaborate with your players to interpret an oracle’s answer.
