## Craft a Story Through Conversation
Roleplaying as a group is conversation. Use this conversation to build a shared imagining of your world. The deeper the conversation, the more opportunities you find to take your story in interesting new directions.

Ask questions of each other to help create a coherent, shared picture of what is happening in the fiction. Deepen your setting and your characters by adding evocative details. You’ll be surprised how often an offhand suggestion can snowball into exciting story possibilities.

## Build a Universe Together
When playing without a guide, you each take part in filling that role, crafting elements of the setting, portraying other characters, introducing challenges, posing questions, and providing answers. The nature of _Starforged_ mechanics and oracles means you can do this in the moment, without preparation, switching from the perspective of your character and back again. When something is uncertain or you want to leave it to the whims of fate, [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] and work together to interpret the answer.

## Share the Spotlight
Be a generous, collaborative player. Within scenes, work to keep each character visible and each player engaged. Use the conversation to give everyone input into the narrative. Share opportunities to roll on oracle tables and interpret the results.

For your broader campaign, don’t let one character’s vow drive your story through every session. Mix it up. Give each character opportunities to explore their own motivations and quests, and find ways to give everyone a personal stake in your sworn vows.
