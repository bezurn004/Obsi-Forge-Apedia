## Oracle: Creature Revealed Aspect {1-2}
> [!mechanics]- | Roll > %%GetDice%% | Guidance
> Roll on this oracle as you interact with the creature to introduce new features or behaviors. Some results may contradict the established nature of a creature. For example, an amorphous creature that you envisioned as a mass of pure energy would not have typical physical features. If a result doesn’t fit, feel free to ignore, reroll, or adjust. Or envision how this contradiction signals a new understanding or unexpected transformation. ^guidance-OcllCreatureRevealedAspect
