# [[_OCL_Index|Oracles Summary]]: Space Encounter Oracles
The Space Sighting Oracles below is your nexus for envisioning the vistas and encounters of your spaceborne journeys. This is particularly useful for revealing what is in range when you [[GB_Navigating the Forge#Anchorages|reach an anchorage]] on an interstellar expedition. You can also use it to identify the destination or focus of a spaceborne quest.

Since space is incomprehensibly vast and empty, don’t feel obligated to use the Space Sightings oracle for every waypoint on an interstellar journey. Instead, you may assume there is nothing of note and move on. Roll for a sighting only when you are inspired to inject uncertainty, danger, strangeness, or narrative potential into your story. Some of these results will be mundane, but others will lead to new wonders or hazards.

Other oracles in this section include: 
- If you are introducing a sector of space into your story, use the [[OCL_Sector-Name|Sector Name Oracle]] to give it a random name.
- Use the [[OCL_Stellar-Object|Stellar Object Oracle]] to learn more about the primary star at a location. This is mostly to help you visualize your surroundings, but the strange or hazardous nature of some rare stars can incite new adventures.
- The [[OCL_Spacee-Fortunes|Spaceborne Peril Oracle]] and [[OCL_Spacee-Fortunes#Oracle Spaceborne Opportunity|Spaceborne Opportunity Oracle]] can help identify the nature of a deep space event.

To learn more about travel and exploration within the Forge, see [[GB_Navigating the Forge|Navigating the Forge (gameplay)]]. 

> Reminder: A result with an arrow symbol (▶) indicates you can jump to another oracle to reveal more detail
