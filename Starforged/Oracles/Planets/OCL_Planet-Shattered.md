OracleDescriptor: "Destructive forces have torn this world to pieces. Chunks of earth and debris orbit around larger sections of the remaining partial planet. The planetary core is no longer in tact and bleeds out into space. What caused this destruction is unknown, but if it is still around, it is surely dangerous."
