## Oracle
Oracle: Planet
OracleFocus: Desert
OracleDescriptor: "An arid land devoid of most life stretches around the globe. If there is any vegetation, it is sparse at best as few plants can survive the choking sandstorms. Rocky sea beds now filled with sand hint that water once covered large areas of the surface centuries or millennia ago. The utter desolation is forbidding."
