# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH1_The Basics|Gameplay]]: Impacts
As you suffer hardships and setbacks in your quests, you may need to mark ==impacts==. These represent temporary, long-term, and permanent disadvantages. Moves will tell you when to mark an impact, or may give you a choice. Some impacts can be cleared by taking the time to recover. Others will forever become a part of your character.

There are several categories of impacts: ==misfortunes==, ==vehicle troubles==, ==burdens==, and ==lasting effects==. 

Impacts have a mechanical effect by reducing your max momentum. Each marked impact reduces your ==max momentum== (normally 10) by 1. For example, if you have three marked impacts, your max momentum is 7. 

Impacts also reduce your ==momentum reset==. 
- If you have one marked impact, your momentum reset is +1 (instead of +2). 
- If you have more than one marked impact, your momentum reset is 0 (instead of +2). - 


## Misfortunes
- ==Wounded== may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail to [[SF_CH3_Endure Harm|Endure Harm (move)]]. You are severely injured.
- ==Shaken== may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to [[SF_CH3_Endure Stress|Endure Stress (move)]]. You are despairing or distraught. 
- ==Unprepared== is marked when you [[SF_CH3_Sacrifice Resources|Sacrafice Resources (move)]] and are reduced to 0 supply. You are not properly equipped for the dangers of the Forge. Because you and your allies share the same supply value, you mark unprepared together.

As with all impacts, ==misfortunes== affect your max momentum and momentum reset. In addition, **if you are wounded, shaken, or unprepared, you cannot increase the associated condition meter. **
- If you are wounded, you cannot increase health. 
- If you are shaken, you cannot increase spirit. 
- If you are unprepared, you cannot increase supply.
 
If a move gives you an opportunity to raise your health, spirit, or supply while the associated misfortune is marked, you can’t take that option. You must clear the impact before improving the related condition meter.

Wounded, shaken, and unprepared can be cleared when you succeed on an appropriate recover move. For example, scoring a hit on the [[SF_CH3_Heal|Heal (move)]] move can clear the wounded impact. Once you clear the misfortune, you restore your max momentum and momentum reset, and you can once again increase the associated meter through moves.

## Vehicle Troubles
- ==Battered== may be marked when your vehicle is at 0 integrity and you fail to [[SF_CH3_Withstand Damage|Withstand Damage (move)]]. The vehicle is barely holding together. 
- Cursed may be marked when your command vehicle ([[AST_Starship|STARSHIP]]) is at 0 integrity and you fail to [[SF_CH3_Withstand Damage|Withstand Damage (move)]]. This is a permanent impact. Your ship will never be quite right again.

Vehicle troubles are linked to a specific vehicle, either your command vehicle asset or a support vehicle asset. These impacts are only a factor when you are piloting or aboard that vehicle. Otherwise, they do not count as an impact and do not affect your maximum momentum and momentum reset.

Battered can be overcome when you successfully [[SF_CH3_Repair|Repair (move)]] that vehicle and clear the trouble. Until you do so, you cannot raise the vehicle’s integrity. Cursed is a permanent impact and will forever plague your [[AST_Starship|STARSHIP]]. To learn more about [[_Vehicle Assets|Vehicle Assets]]. To learn more about [[SF_CH1_Vehicles|Vehicles (The Basics)]] in general in your _Starforged campaign_, see the prior linked page.

> [!tip] Group Play
> If playing with allies, a vehicle trouble affects anyone on the vehicle, regardless of who owns or manages the vehicle asset.

## Burdens
- ==Doomed== is marked when you [[SF_CH3_Face Death|Face Death (move)]] and return from death’s door with a soul-bound quest.
- ==Tormented== is marked when you [[SF_CH3_Face Desolution|Face Desolution (move)]], gain visions of a distressing future, and undertake a quest to prevent that dire fate. 
- ==Indebted== is marked when you [[SF_CH3_Overcome Destruction|Overcome Destruction (move)]]. To replace what was lost and repay the debt, you will take on a duty-bound quest.
 
==Burdens== are a result of life-changing experiences that leave you bound to new vows. Clearing a burden can only be accomplished by resolving the quest.

While you are doomed, tormented, or indebted, you should envision the physical and emotional manifestations of these impacts. You have seen what lies beyond death, suffered visions of your greatest fears, or barely escaped the destruction of your prized starship. How do these events change you? What will you do to set things right? 

## Lasting Effects
- ==Permanently harmed== may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail to [[SF_CH3_Endure Harm|Endure Harm (move)]]. You have suffered a wound that you must reckon with, such as the loss of an eye or hand. Or you bear physical scars that are a constant reminder of a harrowing incident. 
- ==Traumatized== may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to [[SF_CH3_Endure Stress|Endure Stress (move)]]. Your experiences have left you emotionally or mentally scarred.

==Lasting effects== are permanent. They forever impact your character through the momentum adjustment and—more importantly—the narrative impact of being permanently harmed or traumatized. You should factor this impact into how you perform moves and how you interact with the world.

Envision the nature of the lasting effect. You may have physical, emotional, or mental factors you must take into account. Your outlook may change. Your goals and methods may change. How others behave toward you may change.

## Marking Impacts
To mark an impact on your character sheet, fill in the appropriate bubble. Once an impact is marked, it cannot be marked again unless it is cleared. If a move gives you a chance to choose an impact in place of a harsher outcome, you cannot take that option if it is already marked.

### Tracking Vehicle Impacts
Battered or cursed might apply to multiple vehicles, but are only relevant when you are aboard a vehicle with an impact (including a support vehicle managed by an ally).

If a vehicle is battered or cursed, mark that impact on the asset card. When you go aboard, mark it on your character sheet under vehicle troubles as a reminder.

### Adjusting Momentum
Once you mark an impact, adjust your [[SF_CH1_Momentum#Max Momentum|max momentum]] and [[SF_CH1_Momentum#Resetting Momentum|momentum reset]]  as detailed on the linked pages.
- If you have one impact marked, your momentum reset is +1. 
- If you have more than one impact marked, your momentum reset is 0.

## Other Impacts
Certain assets offer abilities at the cost of counting as an impact for your character. For example, the [[AST_Oathbreaker|OATHBREAKER]] asset strengthens your resolve as you pursue a quest of redemption, but counts as an impact until you fulfill that vow.

You can mark these in the “Other Impacts” section of your character sheet. They contribute as normal to your max momentum and momentum reset penalties
