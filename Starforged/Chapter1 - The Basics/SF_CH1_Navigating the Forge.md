# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH1_The Basics|Gameplay]]: Navigating the Forge
The depiction of interstellar travel in _Starforged_ is tied to the gameplay of the ==[[_SF_CH3_Exploration Moves|Exploration Moves]]==. These moves help frame your journeys and encourage exploration and discovery.

You can ignore the setting details described below, and envision interstellar flight as you like. However, it works best if you use a similar approach, with faster-than-light (FTL) travel undertaken in a series of individual segments. Think of your starship as a stone skipping across a vast galactic pond.

## Eidolon Travel
Interstellar starships that travel the Forge—including your character’s ship—are equipped with ==eidolon drives== (commonly referred to as ==e-drives==). These devices harness the turbulent forces of the Forge to propel vessels along optimal paths at FTL speeds.

### Drifts and Passages
==Drifts== are the network of eidolon paths through the Forge. Spacers guide their starships along the gravitational currents, stellar winds, and fiery energies of the drifts like surfers on the crest of a wave.

A plotted course along drifts is called a ==passage==. Important locations in settled areas are usually connected by passages. But this navigational data is a valuable resource, often greedily held by those in power. Others must trailblaze their own paths. Beyond settled regions, potential passages are usually uncharted and unexplored.

Even when following a passage, it’s not just a matter of flying from point A to point B. Piloting the drifts requires skilled navigation. Spacers must be on watch for navigational hazards and lurking foes.

Worse yet, some say eidolon travel weakens the fragile bonds of reality. Explorers tell stories of horrifying visions or visitations among the drifts. Spacers are superstitious folk, and often employ wards and rituals to keep eidolon “ghosts” at bay.

### Anchorages
An e-drive can stay powered for a few hours at most, and requires several hours to reenergize. Thus, long voyages are made in a series of FTL transits. Each segment of the journey ends at a waypoint—what is called an ==anchorage==. Since powerful gravity wells are an ideal navigational target, anchorages are often near a large object such as a star or planet.

Once emerging from the drifts at an anchorage, the ship slows while the e-drive is powered back up. You can sit back and enjoy the scenery during this layover, or go take a look at nearby locations.

## Seeing What's Out There
When you pilot your starship on an interstellar journey through uncharted space, make the [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] to see how you fare. Anchorages are a waypoint that helps define progress on that journey. When you emerge from eidolon travel at an anchorage, envision the moment as your starship decelerates to sublight speeds: The hull rattles, warning tones beep, and sensor displays spring to life. 

### Near Objects
When traveling the Forge, you can simply envision the beautiful but mundane sites you encounter. A sky filled with the cold light of distant suns. Clouds of stellar dust. Barren planetoids drifting in their lonely orbits.

If you want to give a segment of your travel additional focus, [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]] and use the random prompts in the [[_SF_CH5_Index|Oracles section]], starting with the [[SF_CH5_Space-Sightings|Space Sightings table]]. You might find a fiery star looming in your cockpit windows, a vibrant planet, a starship carrying a fellow traveler, or even a spaceborne creature. The Space Sightings table may prompt you to roll twice or three times for multiple objects.

These objects are ==near== your starship. If you want to travel to a near object or get in a better position to observe it, your starship’s main engines will carry you there in a matter of minutes. If you find something worthy of further exploration, you can [[SF_CH3_Explore a Waypoint|Explore a Waypoint (move)]]. Unusual locations, such as a precursor vault or derelict, might even warrant their own expedition.

### Far Objects
If you want to look deeper into the depths of an anchorage, roll on the Space Sightings table again to see if there is anything interesting ==far== from your starship. Envision yourself studying scanner data and visual displays, peering through the Forge’s stellar gases. This doesn’t require a move unless you’re under pressure—it’s just a routine part of being a spacer.

If you see something interesting at far range and want to check it out, it’ll take a while. Sublight travel is ponderous. You’re also diverting power from energizing the e-drive, so all told the detour will cost about a day. For an explorer, this might be time well spent. For a spacer on an urgent mission, it’s a needless distraction. Either way, unless you’re dealing with something risky, this doesn’t trigger a move. Point your ship in the right direction, envision the journey, and play to see what happens when you arrive.

### Out of Range Objects
Anything beyond far range is ==out of range==. Objects at this distance are of no concern—they are too far away to cause you trouble, and it would take too long to travel there using your main engines. Objects smaller and dimmer than a star are probably shrouded in the stellar muck and electromagnetic interference of the Forge anyway. Perhaps that’s for the best; some things are best left undiscovered.
