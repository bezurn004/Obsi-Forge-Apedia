# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH1_The Basics|Gameplay]]: Equipment
As noted earlier, your ==[[SF_CH1_Condition Meters#Supply|supply meter]]== is an abstract representation of your overall readiness. You are otherwise armed, armored, and equipped as appropriate to your vision of your character.

Some assets can make specific equipment more relevant to your character. If you are a [[AST_Gearhead|GEARHEAD]], you probably envision yourself always having a toolkit at the ready. Combat-centric assets such as [[AST_Gunner|GUNNER]] represent your expertise in a particular weapon or fighting style. These tools reinforce your character’s approach and skills.

Other equipment provides narrative benefit. It enables you to make moves where that gear is important, or perhaps allows you to avoid the risky nature of a move altogether.

Make note of equipment at whatever level of detail you like, but don’t fuss over it. During the character creation exercise you’ll receive your [[SF_CH2_Gear Up#Your Spacer Kit|spacer kit]], which includes fundamental gear for exploring a perilous galaxy. If you ever need to know if you have a specific helpful item, make the [[SF_CH3_Check Your Gear|Check Your Gear (move)]].

> [!cite] Narrative example
> You must make your way down a steep rock face on a barren desert planet. Without assistance, you’d make the [[SF_CH3_Face Danger|Face Danger (move)]] to see what happens. If you had rope, the climb is not particularly risky or uncertain. In that case, you can skip the move and just envision the result.

## Depiciting Technology In the Forge
By default, life in the Forge is a retro-future. It is the future as viewed through a lens of what we imagined two or three decades ago, instead of what we can envision today. It is also a resource-scarce future, with much of your people’s knowledge and resources lost following the cataclysm that drove you to the Forge.

That said, the technology you bring to bear—or resist—is flexible to how you envision the nature of the setting. Is a typical gun a blaster that fires plasma bursts, or an old-fashioned slug thrower? Are spacecraft sleek and powerful, or are they ungainly, fragile machines held together with fervent prayer? Your setting can suffer from class disparity, with advanced tech under the control of the wealthy and powerful, while everyone else is forced to make do with more primitive resources. Meanwhile, scavengers searching the ancient places of the Forge might unearth technologies of strange and terrible power.

The truths you define for the Forge during [[SF_CH2_Choose Your Truths|Campaign Creation]] help frame the nature of equipment and tech in your campaign.
