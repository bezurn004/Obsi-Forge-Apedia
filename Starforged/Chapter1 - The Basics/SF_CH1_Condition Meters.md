# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH1_The Basics|Gameplay]]: Condition Meters
Along the right side of your character sheet are three ==condition meters==: ==**health**==, ==**spirit**==, and ==**supply**==. These measure your character’s readiness and status. As with the momentum meter, you can use a paperclip or token to mark the current values. These meters may rise and fall throughout a typical session. Their values are reduced when you face hardship through a [[_SF_CH3_Suffer Moves|Suffer Moves]], and increased when you make [[_SF_CH3_Recover Moves|Recover Moves]]. 

## Health
==Health== represents your current physical condition and stamina, ranked from 0 to 5. Health is reduced when you [[SF_CH3_Endure Harm|Endure Harm (move)]], and increased when you rest or receive care through moves such as [[SF_CH3_Heal|Heal (move)]]. If you are at 0 health, scoring a miss when you [[SF_CH3_Endure Harm|Endure Harm (move)]] puts you at risk of suffering an [[SF_CH1_Impacts|Impact]] or dying.

## Spirit
==Spirit== is your current morale and mental state, ranked from 0 to 5. Spirit is reduced when you [[SF_CH3_Endure Stress|Endure Stress (move)]]. It is increased when you find comfort in companionship or relaxed moments through moves such as [[SF_CH3_Hearten|Hearten]]. If you are at 0 spirit, scoring a miss when you [[SF_CH3_Endure Stress|Endure Stress (move)]] puts you at risk of suffering an impact or falling into desolation.

*47 CONDITION METERS*

## Supply 
==Supply== represents your preparedness, including food, water, fuel, weapons, ammo, equipment, cargo, money, and general upkeep. Supply is ranked from 0 to 5. It is decreased when you make the [[SF_CH3_Sacrifice Resources|Sacrafice Resources (move)]], and is increased when you [[SF_CH3_Resupply|Resupply (move)]] to fortify your provisions and readiness. If you need to know if you have a specific item or resource at hand, make the [[SF_CH3_Check Your Gear|Check Your Gear (move)]]. When you [[SF_CH3_Sacrifice Resources|Sacrafice Resources (move)]] and your supply falls to 0, you must [[SF_CH1_Impacts#Misfortunes|mark unprepared]]

### Supply and Allies
> [!tip] Group Play
> If you are playing with others, the supply meter represents the shared resources among your party. You and your allies use the same supply value while you travel together. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer the result of an outcome that forces you to [[SF_CH3_Sacrifice Resources|Sacrafice Resources (move)]], each of you adjust your supply meter accordingly. If anyone must mark unprepared, everyone marks unprepared.

## Asset Condition Meters
Several assets have their own condition meters. 
- Your [[AST_Starship|Starship (asset)]] and other vehicles have an integrity meter (seen on this asset card) to measure their condition. When your vehicle faces a damaging situation, make the [[SF_CH3_Withstand Damage|Withstand Damage (move)]]. To get a vehicle back up to speed, make the [[SF_CH3_Repair|Repair (move)]]. 
- Companion assets have a health meter that is reduced when you make the [[SF_CH3_Companion Takes a Hit|Companion Takes a Hit (move)]]. Their health is increased through the [[SF_CH3_Heal|Heal (move)]] when you treat them or obtain treatment—or using the [[SF_CH3_Repair|Repair (move)]] for mechanical companions. 
- Some assets have a unique condition meter for a specialized resource. For example, if you are a [[AST_Firebrand|FIREBRAND]], you have a fire meter and tap into that inner source to unleash destructive energies. To track the value of a condition meter on an asset card, make a mark, or use a paperclip or token. You can also set a six-sided die on top of the card and rotate it to show the current value. The value of a meter cannot exceed the maximum shown on the card. Learn more about [[SF_CH1_Assets|Assets (the basics)]] here on the linked page.

## Action Rolls and Condition Meters
Some moves prompt you to make an action roll using the value of a condition meter instead of a stat. For example, when you [[SF_CH3_Check Your Gear|Check Your Gear (move)]], the move tells you to “roll +supply.” When you see an action framed as “roll +\[condition meter\],” use the value of that meter in your action roll as if it were a stat. 

Some assets allow you to use the value of a condition meter as an add for your action roll, phrased as “add +\[condition meter\].” This is a boost to your action score in addition to your stat, rather than a replacement for the stat.
