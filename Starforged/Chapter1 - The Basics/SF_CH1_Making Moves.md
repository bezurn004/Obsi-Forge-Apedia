# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH1_The Basics|Gameplay]]: Making Moves
==Moves== are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in _Starforged_. Moves are centered on the players and protagonists. Other characters do not make moves.

## Moves Card
> **Swear an Iron Vow** _<- This is the move name_
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^trigger]]
> This is the move’s ==trigger==. Triggers are phrased as “when you [blank].” When you do that thing, or encounter that situation, make the move.

> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^action-roll]]
> Moves requiring ==[[SF_CH1_Action Roll|action roll]]== will tell you what stat to add to your roll, and may give you an option to include other bonuses.

> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^strong-hit]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^weak-hit]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^miss]]
> Moves with an action roll include three levels of possible results: a ==strong hit==, a ==weak hit==, and a ==miss==.
> When a move’s name is referenced within these rules or by another move, you’ll see it as _linked_ text _with "(move)" appended_. If you are reading the _Starforged_ rulebook on a digital device, clicking or _hovering_ on linked text will take you to the full summary for that move.

## Moves and Dice
Most moves are based on risky actions from the perspective of your character. You duck behind cover in a gunfight, fly your starship through a dense asteroid field, or give medical care to an ally. These moves use dice to determine the outcome. This is called an ==[[SF_CH1_Action Roll|action roll]]==. 

A few moves measure your headway against an extended challenge, such as an expedition or fight, using a ==[[SF_CH1_Progress Tracks#Progress Tracks|progress track]]==. These are called ==progress moves==. When you are ready to resolve a challenge, you make a ==progress roll==.

Other moves utilize a different kind of dice roll, called an ==[[SF_CH1_Oracles|oracles roll]]==. These moves help determine the outcome of uncertain events out of your character’s control. 

Some moves don’t require a roll. They might complement or reference a separate move, help you manage your character and their challenges, or support you in managing a session. Don’t roll dice unless a move tells you to. We’ll cover all the [[SF_CH1_Action Roll|basic dice rolling mechanics]] in a later page.

## Referencing Moves
_Starforged_ moves are based on the structure created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker in their Apocalypse World roleplaying game. If you’re familiar with Apocalypse World, or other games using that framework (called Powered by the Apocalypse), you might be surprised by the relatively large number of moves in _Starforged_.

Don’t be intimidated. You are not expected to memorize _Starforged_ moves. After playing the game for a bit, you’ll start to become familiar with their organization and triggers. They are categorized by activities, which means you tend to focus on a subset of moves for a particular scene. When more than one move seems to apply, use the one most specific to the situation.

Once you understand the basics of rolling dice and managing your character’s resources—as detailed in this chapter—the options and outcomes within moves help create a perilous, propulsive story.

> Reference sheets for moves are available as part of the _Starforged Playkit_. This print-and-play bundle is available for download at ironswornrpg.com. Use these materials to help guide your actions and resolve the outcome of those actions. Additional details and tips for each move can be found in Chapter 3 ([[_SF_CH3_Gameplay In Depth|Gameplay In Depth]]), but you can save that for when you have questions or are ready to delve deeper

## Making Group Moves
When you are adventuring with allies—protagonists portrayed by other players—one of you often make moves to resolve a challenge for the group. This represents that character taking the lead in a particular scene.

Unless a move specifically offers benefits for your allies, any mechanical bonus you gain from a move is applied only to the character making the move. For example, if you represent your group as you [[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow|Swear an Iron Vow (move)]] and score a strong hit, you take the mechanical reward (per the move, “take +2 momentum”). Everyone else benefits from the narrative success. The exception are moves such as [[SF_CH3_Sojourn|Sojourn (move)]] with specific options for your allies to take their own benefits.

When you make a move for the group, allies can contribute to your action by making the [[SF_CH3_Aid Your Ally|Aid Your Ally (move)]]. If they are successful, you gain a bonus you can leverage to improve your own chance of success. If more than one ally makes this move, bonuses can be stacked. However, keep in mind that moves are inherently risky, and multiple moves will dramatically increase the chance of failure.

When you make a move for your group and face a negative outcome, you should apply mechanical and narrative costs to an individual or the group in a way that best fits the current situation.

%% #addition %% _If a move has guidance on group play, a section of the move card has a special call out that can be expanded to reference these guidelines more easily. Below is an example from **Swear an Iron Vow**_
![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^group-play]]

> [!cite] Narrative example
> You are at the helm of your starship as you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] across a sector riddled with violent and unpredictable stellar storms. Your allies put their faith in your talents as a pilot, and you take the lead for this segment of the journey. You make the move and roll the dice

## Best Practices For Moves
### Not Everything Is a Move
Don’t let your session jump from move to move without any roleplay, worldbuilding, or storytelling in between. If you’re doing something safe and certain, it’s not a move. If you want to gloss over something, do it.

Many moves offer potential benefits and costs, and it’s ultimately your decision whether to risk the move to gain the reward. If you happen across a planetside settlement in your travels and decide to roleplay some low-key interactions with friendly locals, that’s not a move. However, if you are wounded and your ship is badly damaged, making the [[SF_CH3_Sojourn|Sojourn (move)]] move at that settlement gives you an opportunity to recover.

%% #addition %% _Some moves have guidance on when it is not appropriate to take that move. There may be a suggestion for another move that is more appropriate. Double check this guidance to make sure you are not making more moves than are needed. While it may be fun to make a lot of moves, there are more often than not negative consequences that will make the game harder and bog down the story. Below is a reference from the move **Face Danger**_
![[SF_CH3_Face Danger#^improper]]

### Making Moves Matter
Let your moves flow organically out of your story. Don’t make moves purely for a mechanical benefit without some support in the fiction. Don’t repeat a move trying to get your desired outcome. A move, hit or miss, should always result in a change to the current situation.

However, there will be times when you make a move multiple times in sequence. In combat, you might attack or defend with consecutive actions. When you are traveling on a long journey, you might roll several times to make progress on the expedition. That’s fine as long as the moves don’t get too mechanical. Break up the flow of play with other actions and narrative beats. When in doubt, follow this guideline: If you’ve made the same move three times in a row, switch things up.

> [!cite] Narrative example
> You are trying to convince a faction leader to agree to an alliance. You roleplay how you attempt to reason with them. Then, you make the [[SF_CH3_Compel|Compel (move)]] and fail. They refused. Why? What do you learn or what do they do to make your situation more complex or dangerous? Whatever happens, something happens. You can’t [[SF_CH3_Compel|Compel (move)]] them again without new leverage or a different approach.

### Managing Negative Outcomes
Moves can represent escalating danger. A failure on one move might result in a minor complication or hardship, while leading the character into more perilous circumstances. The outcome of additional failures can progressively worsen to show control slipping out of the character’s grasp.

Some moves will make this explicit by giving you a specific bad outcome. Otherwise, ratcheting up the severity of failure is a technique to create increasing tension and danger. Whether you are playing a character or moderating the game as the guide, this is a valuable tool to manage the intensity of the story
