# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH1_The Basics|Gameplay]]: Progress Tracks
A ==progress track== measures your headway against a goal or obstacle, and is used to resolve whether you ultimately succeed or fail against that challenge. 
- When you [[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow|Swear an Iron Vow (move)]], a progress track represents the challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your goal. 
- When you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]], a progress track represents how favorable the journey has been.
- When you [[SF_CH3_Make a Connection|Make a Connection (move)]], a progress track represents the evolution of the relationship. 
- When you [[SF_CH3_Enter the Fray|Enter The Fray (move)]], a progress track represents your advantage as you attempt to achieve your objective.

Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes that you fill in—or ==mark==—as you advance toward your goal. When you initiate a challenge, these boxes are empty.

## Challenge Ranks
When you create a progress track, give the challenge a ==rank==. In increasing order of severity, the ranks are ==troublesome==, ==dangerous==, ==formidable==, ==extreme==, and ==epic==.

Ranks help gauge the difficulty of a challenge. More importantly, they are a measure of its complexity. Higher ranked challenges will require more focus, more steps to complete, and more time—both in the imagined world and at the table. Troublesome is used for simple challenges. Dangerous is a typical challenge. ==Formidable== is an intimidating challenge. Epic and extreme challenges require great effort and luck to overcome.

Important NPCs can be given a rank to help gauge their relative scale, power, and abilities. If you are undertaking a quest to defeat an NPC, facing an NPC in a fight, or establishing an NPC as a connection, their rank is considered along with the other aspects of the situation and goal.

When choosing a challenge rank, you should also consider how well your character is positioned. If circumstances give you an unusual advantage or disadvantage, nudge the rank up or down appropriately. For example, if you [[SF_CH3_Enter the Fray|Enter The Fray (move)]] weaponless and facing armed foes, you would raise the rank of your objective to reflect that disparity. If you secure the aid of a local scout before you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]], you could lower the rank of the journey to represent their help.

## Marking Progress
Once you initiate a progress track, you make specific moves to advance toward that goal. These moves reward you with an opportunity to mark progress on the progress track for that challenge. For example, as you achieve victories on your path to fulfilling a vow, you [[SF_CH3_Reach a Milestone|Reach a Milestone]] and mark progress.

![[SF_CH3_Reach a Milestone#Reach A Milestone Move Card]]

Similarly, you mark progress on a journey when you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] and reach a waypoint. For a connection, you mark progress as you [[SF_CH3_Develop a Relationship|Develop a Relationship (move)]]. In a fight, you make moves such as [[SF_CH3_Strike|Strike (move)]] or [[SF_CH3_Gain Ground|Gain Ground (move)]] to mark progress against your objectives. These incremental moves let you amass advantages to have the best chance of success when you are ready to resolve the challenge.

Asset abilities may also offer an opportunity to mark progress on a challenge. For example, if you are a [[AST_Brawler|BRAWLER]] and [[SF_CH3_Enter the Fray|Enter The Fray (move)]] positioned in close quarters against your foe, you have the chance to immediately mark progress on an objective in that fight. 

### How To Mark Progress
Each ==box== in a progress track is filled with lines called ticks. A full box consists of four ticks in a star-shaped pattern. When a move or asset ability prompts you to mark progress, check the rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the illustration below. The boxes in a track are filled progressively from left to right.

## Stacking Progress
If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

In addition, if a move or asset prompts you to “mark progress twice,” do so. For example, when you [[SF_CH3_Strike|Strike]] and score a hit, you may mark progress twice against your objective for that fight. Any additional instances of “mark progress” gained through an asset ability stack on top of that reward

> [!cite] Narrative example
> You [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] across the wind-blasted terrain of the desert planet Sirocco. You have given the expedition a rank of dangerous, and are riding your [[AST_Hoverbike|HOVERBIKE]] support vehicle asset. You make the move for the first segment of the expedition, and roll a strong hit with a match. Per the [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]], you mark progress on a strong hit. Your [[AST_Hoverbike|HOVERBIKE]] also has an ability that prompts you to mark progress when you score a strong hit with a match on an expedition. Between the move and the asset, that’s two instances of “mark progress” for this action. When you mark progress against a dangerous challenge, you normally mark 2 boxes. Since you can mark progress twice for this action, you mark 4 boxes total. Your trusty [[AST_Hoverbike|HOVERBIKE]] has sped you along on this expedition.

## Managing Progress Tracks
Your character sheet includes a progress track for your background vow, which is an epic vow you define when you create your character.

You can create and mark other progress tracks in your journal, on notepaper, or using the worksheets available within the _Starforged Playkit_. Some progress tracks—such as a combat track or low-ranked expedition track—might only be needed to resolve a scene or two. But most progress tracks will persist across sessions. For example, if you have a high-ranked connection you visit infrequently, their progress track may remain incomplete for the bulk of your campaign.

If you are playing _Starforged_ with a digital tool, progress tracks are likely built into the interface. Or use whatever approach works for you to emulate boxes and ticks.

## Progress Moves
There are several key moves, called ==progress moves==, which utilize progress tracks to resolve the outcome of challenges. For example, to see how you fare when you seize an objective in a fight, make the [[SF_CH3_Take Decisive Action|Take Decisive Action (move)]].

> **Take Decisive Action**
> ![[SF_CH3_Take Decisive Action#^trigger]]
> This label identifies a move as a progress move
> ![[SF_CH3_Take Decisive Action#^progress-roll]]
> A progress move uses a progress roll instead of an action roll. See [[#Progress Rolls]] for how it works.
> ![[SF_CH3_Take Decisive Action#^strong-hit]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Take Decisive Action#^weak-hit]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Take Decisive Action#^miss]]

*42 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS*

## Progress Rolls
You don’t make an action roll when making a ==progress move==. Instead, tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four ticks). This is your ==progress score==. Then, roll only the challenge dice and compare your progress score to the value of the dice. This is called a ==progress roll==.

Important: It’s not necessary to fill your progress track before making your progress move. When deciding whether to make a progress move, you need to weigh the chance of success against the risk of continuing to make preparatory moves.

As with an action roll, if your progress score beats the challenge dice, it’s a strong hit. If you beat one of the challenge dice, it’s a weak hit. If you fail to beat either die, it’s a miss. The progress move will tell you how to resolve the challenge based on the outcome of your roll.

In the example below, compare your progress score of 5 to your challenge dice when making the progress move. The sixth progress box is only partially filled in, and doesn’t count toward the progress score.

> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#^progress-track-diagram-2]]

### Momentum and Progress Rolls
Momentum is ignored when you make a progress move. You cannot ==burn momentum== on a progress roll, and you do not suffer ==negative momentum==.

### Sharing Progress Tracks With Allies
> [!tip] Group Play
> When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a quest, expedition, connection, or fight—you share a progress track. This is called a shared challenge. When a move prompts someone to mark progress for that challenge, it is marked on your shared progress track.
> 
> When you make a progress move for a shared challenge, only one of you rolls the dice. The result will stand for the group.

If you are successful as you make a progress move to [[SF_CH3_Fullfill Your Vow|Fullfill Your Vow (move)]], [[SF_CH3_Forge a Bond|Forge a Bound (move)]], or [[SF_CH3_Finish an Expedition|Finish an Expedition (move)]], anyone who was part of the shared challenge earns the legacy reward and marks the appropriate legacy track. See the next page for how that works.
