# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Player Characters
You use a ==character sheet== (shown on the opposite page, and available as part of the _Starforged Playkit_) to manage the main aspects of your character. This sheet includes components such as a ==momentum meter==, ==condition meters==, and ==impacts==. We’ll cover these later in this chapter.

The character sheet also includes your ==[[GSRY_Definitions#^stats|stats]]==. These are core to your character’s capabilities, nature, and approach. In the next chapter, you’ll create your character and assign each stat a value from 1 to 3. Then, when things get risky or uncertain, you roll dice and use one of your stats as a bonus. 

The stats are: 
- ==[[GSRY_Definitions#^edge|Edge]]==: quickness, agility, and prowess when fighting at a distance. 
- ==[[GSRY_Definitions#^heart|Heart]]==: courage, willpower, empathy, sociability, and loyalty. 
- ==[[GSRY_Definitions#^iron|Iron]]==: physical strength, endurance, aggressiveness, and prowess when fighting at close quarters
- ==[[GSRY_Definitions#^shadow|Shadow]]==: sneakiness, deceptiveness, and cunning. 
- ==[[GSRY_Definitions#^wits|Wits]]==: expertise, knowledge, and observation. 

Another key aspect of your character is your ==assets==, an example of which is shown below. They are formatted as poker-sized cards. Assets provide ==abilities== that can improve or modify your actions. They are acquired when you create your character and as you gain experience. In this rulebook, asset names are shown with **"(asset)"** after their name. You can learn more about [[GB_Assets|Assets (gameplay)]] here.

> Your five ==stats== are given a value from 1 to 3. A stat is often added as a bonus when you take action

> As you fulfill ==vows==, form bonds, and explore the galaxy, you gain ==experience== on ==legacy tracks==.

> The ==condition meters== for ==health==, ==spirit==, and ==supply== represent your overall readiness.

> Throughout play, you gain and lose ==momentum==. You can use positive momentum to improve the result of an action. Negative momentum can undermine your actions.

> You suffer ==impacts== as you face harrowing challenges. Some impacts are temporary and easily mended; others are permanent.

> ==Vows== are sacred oaths to complete perilous quests. You decide a ==background vow== when you create your character.

### You Are Ironsworn
Your character is not just an array of mechanical bits and bobs. They are a person, grounded in the fiction of your setting. They have hopes and fears, virtues and failings. In the exercises in the next chapter, you’ll create your character and define their nature and background. For now, here are some default assumptions:
- **You are driven**: Many live out their lives barely venturing beyond the shelter of their orbital station or planetside outpost, but you are different. Your sworn ==vows== lead to a life of danger, heroism, and sacrifice at the edge of known space—and beyond. 
- **You are a spacer**: For most, space is lonely, cold, incomprehensibly vast, and full of peril. For you—at least for now—it is home. You have a starship, and the depths of this largely uncharted galaxy call to you. 
- You are competent: You might specialize in a particular career or set of skills, but you are broadly self-reliant and capable. 
- **You are imperfect**: You are not without your limitations. You’ll make bad decisions. You will fail. Fate will conspire against you. Overcoming those hardships, pushing on, is what makes you heroic. 
- **You are unbound**: The default setting is human-centric, and _Starforged_ does not include specific options to play aliens, robots, or other non-human science fiction archetypes. Aside from that consideration, envision your character as you like. There are no gameplay or setting restrictions that constrain your character’s race, culture, disabilities, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

### Other Characters
The mechanics and fiction of _Starforged_ are almost entirely focused on the actions and intent of your character. But you are not alone in the Forge; there are other characters who will take a role in your story. 

- If you are playing a co-op or guided game with other players, their characters are referred to in these rules as your ==allies==. 
- A ==companion== is a special type of ==asset==. They are a person, creature, or robotic helper who accompanies you on your adventures. 
- ==NPCs== (non-player characters and creatures) are the other characters who inhabit your universe. They can have a single mechanical attribute, their ==rank==, to help set their relative scale and abilities. But you do not roll dice for them. When you attempt to influence them, oppose them, or aid them, take action from your character’s perspective. 
- As you explore the Forge and undertake quests, you establish deeper relationships with NPCs—called ==connections==—who become a more vital part of your campaign
