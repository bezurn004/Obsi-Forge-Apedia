# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]]: What You Need To Play
You’ll need some dice to play _Starforged_: 
- Two ten-sided dice (d10) for each player. These are challenge dice. 
- One six-sided die (d6) for each player. This is an action die. 
- Optionally, another pair of ten-sided dice to use as oracle dice. You’ll also need some print-and-play materials (available for download at ironswornrpg.com): 
- One set of ==asset cards== (also available for purchase as a preprinted card deck). 
- The ==_Starforged Playkit_==, a set of reference sheets and worksheets.

Finally, you may want a journal or notebook to record your adventure log. 

## Schedule Your Starforged Sessions
If you’re playing solo, a session can be as long as you like, from a few minutes to a few hours. If you’re playing with others, you probably want to dedicate enough time to make some progress in your quests; plan on a couple of hours or more.

> If you prefer to use digital platforms such as a virtual tabletop to play _Starforged_, or some combination of digital and analogue tools, check ironswornrpg.com for links to the most popular resources.
