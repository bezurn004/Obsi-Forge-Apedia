# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]] - [[_GNPC_Foes-Encounters|Foes and Encounters]]: Forging NPCs
An NPC (non-player character/creature) is anyone who inhabits your campaign other than your character and those portrayed by your fellow players. They can be a person, being, or creature. As you play, you introduce and encounter NPCs that fit your version of the setting, enhance your story, and enrich your character’s adventures.

This chapter includes an array of [[_Denizen Index|Sample NPCs]] as inspiration for foes and encounters in your story. But because NPCs don’t have mechanical detail and are represented almost entirely in the fiction of your story, you can envision and resolve your interactions with other people and lifeforms without advance preparation.

## Interacting with NPCs
NPCs, as appropriate to their nature and intent, may ignore you, aid you, or oppose you. When your interactions with them involve uncertainty and risk, make appropriate moves to see what happens. Springboard off those moves with new details and complications to flesh out these characters. When you are unsure of their traits or next action, [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]].

Reoccurring NPCs should have more detail and narrative weight. Give them personalities, unique looks, quirks, and motivations. Let them throw the occasional wrench in the works of your quests with a surprising revelation. Make a note of what you learn of them. If you [[MV_Make a Connection|Make a Connection]] with them, track your progress as you build that relationship.

## Generating NPCs Using Oracles
In the [[_OCL_Index|Oracles Section]], you’ll find an extensive set of random tables, including generators to help populate your galaxy.
- [[_OCL_Characters|Characters Oracles]] to reveal aspects of a person, including their disposition, role, traits, goals, and name.
- [[_OCL_Creatures|Creatures Oracles]] to generate a creature’s form, encountered behavior, and other aspects.
- [[_OCL_Factions|Factions Oracles]] to introduce a group of NPCs as a ruling power, guild, or fringe group.

Don’t try to build a fully formed understanding of a person, being, or creature when you first encounter them; instead, focus on what your character learns or perceives as a first impression. You can envision or generate additional details over time. See [[OCL_Using Oracles#Oracles Tips and Tricks|Tips on Using Oracles]] for details.

## Other Sources Of Inspiration
Since you don’t need to worry about “building” NPCs under mechanical constraints, you can easily take inspiration from other games and media. Or pick and choose NPCs from the Ironsworn rulebook or Delve supplement, reimagining them to fit the spaceborne setting.
