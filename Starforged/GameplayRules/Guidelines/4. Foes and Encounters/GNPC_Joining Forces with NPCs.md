# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]] - [[_GNPC_Foes-Encounters|Foes and Encounters]]: Joining Forces with NPCs
If your story leads you to cooperating with helper NPCs to overcome challenges, consider how they impact the fiction and your moves. Unless they are a [[GB_Assets#Companions|Compantion]]  or [[_Connection Moves|Connection]], an NPC won’t give you mechanical bonuses on your actions. They also won’t make moves of their own. They are simply a part of your story, perhaps impacting the moves you make, the results of those moves, and the rank of your challenges.

For example: 
- If a powerful NPC agrees to support you on a sworn quest by granting a request or providing a key resource, you can [[MV_Reach a Milestone|Reach a Milestone]] and mark progress on that vow.
- If you are fighting alongside NPCs, you can reduce the rank of your [[_Combat Moves#Combat Objectives|objective in a fight]]. For example, battling alone to repel a raider assault might be an extreme objective. If you are aided by a stalwart band of settlers, you could shift the rank to formidable.
- If you are charged with protecting NPCs, they might be placed in danger or suffer losses when you face a cost or concession. For example, if you are attacked by pirates while protecting a fleet of refugee ships on an interstellar journey, you might envision those ships taking hits or being boarded.
- An NPC with specialized skills or resources might give you opportunities to make or avoid specific moves. For example, if you gain navigation charts for an interstellar passage from a helpful navigator, you could [[MV_Set a Course|Set a Course]]. This would allow you to resolve the journey in a single zoomed-out move, instead of making it a more complex, lengthy, and perilous expedition.

As with any NPC, you can [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]] to see how a helper NPC responds, how they fare in a challenge, or what they do next. If you are attempting to influence them in a risky or uncertain situation, make moves such as [[MV_Compel|Compel]] to see what happens. If they will have a reoccurring role in your story, you can [[MV_Make a Connection|Make a Connection]] with them.

> NPCs, even if they are a connection, are independent characters. They might accompany you on a specific mission, but they have their own goals and responsibilities and will soon part ways with you. If an NPC earns a place aboard your ship, you can formalize the relationship with the [[AST_Sidekick|SIDEKICK]] or an appropriate creature or bot companion asset.
