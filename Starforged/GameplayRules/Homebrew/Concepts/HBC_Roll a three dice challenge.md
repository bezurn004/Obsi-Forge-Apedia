# Roll a Three Dice Challenge
This is the mechanic that Shawn uses on some of the original Starforged assets where you roll three challenge dice and keep two. Itâ€™s like advantage, but if any challenge dice match, you must keep those. This is a cool mechanic because matches are now more likely which in turn gives you more swingy results of either a strong hit with a match or a miss with a match.
