# [[_CSG_Sector Creation Summary|Sector Creation]]: Creating A Starting Sector
%% #addition a bit of flavor text for the combined page%%_This is the first step in creating a sector, where broad strokes are painted on the canvass on a vast field of stars and potential planets._

## Choose Your Starting Region
The Forge is a vast galaxy, so let’s choose a ==region== to begin your adventures. As described in more detail in the [[GB_Tone and Setting#Regions of the Forge|Tone and Setting]], the Forge is divided broadly into four regions. Choose your starting region and make note of it on your sector worksheet.

==**Terminus**==: Settlements are relatively common here, and spaceborne routes between communities are usually well-charted. If you want to focus on interacting with other people and communities, start here.

==**Outlands**==: This region represents an area of recent expansion. Settlements here are scattered, and navigational paths are often uncharted and perilous. If you envision yourself as a spacer on a wild frontier, start here.

==**Expanse**==: Only a few bold pioneers have delved these far-flung reaches. If you’re ready to face the dangers of lonely exploration within uncharted space, start here.

==**Void**==: In the reaches beyond the Forge, isolated stars are separated by vast gulfs of nothing. Travel and settling here is impractical if not impossible. Don’t start your campaign here. 

The choices you made when you selected your campaign truths will influence how you envision the regions and the people who live there. But the relative differences between the regions will remain the same: The Terminus is where the bulk of your people live, the Outlands is an expanding frontier, and the Expanse is what lies beyond.

## Determine the Number of Settlements
A ==settlement== is a location populated by other humans. Settlements can be planetside habitats, orbital stations, or deep space facilities. They offer a place for you to recuperate after your adventures in the Forge have taken their toll. More importantly, settlements are a nexus for roleplaying and quest opportunities.

In this exercise, you’ll generate a few settlements in your starting sector. First, determine the number of known settlements in the sector based on the region where it’s located.

| Sector Region | Number of Settlements |
|:--- |:--- |
| Terminus | 4 |
| Outlands | 3 |
| Expanse | 2 |
^table-settlements-per-region

Note that this doesn’t represent a standard for how you’ll populate other sectors as you explore the Forge. It just gives us something manageable for this exercise.
#ambiguous _It is not certain how to "create a new sector" in the rulebook outside of this chapter, perhaps I missed it??_

## Generate Settlement Details
Put a marker in this page so you can come back to it, and jump to the [[_OCL_Settlements|Settlements Oracle]]. For each of the settlements in your starting sector, roll on the following tables: 
- [[OCL_Settle-Name|Settlement Name]]
- [[OCL_Settle-Creation|Settlement Location]]
- [[OCL_Settle-Creation#Settlement Population|Settlement Population]]
- [[OCL_Settle_Approach#Oracle: Settlement Authority|Settlement Authority]]
- [[OCL_Settle-Concerns#Oracle Settlement Projects|Settlement Projects]]

> Write the details for each settlement in the location blocks on your sector worksheet. Keep it short and simple. 
> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#^diagram-sector-creation-1]]

For now, don’t roll on the other settlement tables. You can reveal other aspects of these places when you visit and interact with them.

## Generate Planets
[[_OCL_Planets|Planet Oracles]]
If any of the settlements are located on a planet, or in orbit around a planet, you can **identify** and **name** the planet to help flesh out the nature of the location.

To learn the planet’s basic type, go to [[_OCL_Planets#Oracle: Planets|Planet Oracles]] . Roll once for each planetside or orbital settlement.

Optionally, give each planet a name. If you need inspiration, take a look at the sample names for each planet type on [[_OCL_Planets#Oracle: Planet Names (All)|Oracle: Planet Names (All)]]. For now, don’t roll on the other tables available for each planet; when you visit those places, you can reveal more about them.

## Generate Stars
If you’d like to know the nature of the primary stars these settlements and planets orbit, [[OCL_Stellar-Object|Stellar Object Oracle]] and roll once for each settlement.

This will usually just add a bit of scenery for these locations. For example, you might envision how a blue star bathes the settlement in a harsh, cold light. Or how a hypergiant fills the sky with a fiery glow.

An unusual star such as a corrupted star or impending supernova might actually have a narrative impact on your starting situation, perhaps even influencing your initial challenges and quests.

> You may add the basic info for generated planets and stars to the location block on your sector worksheet. Leave some room to expand on these details later.
