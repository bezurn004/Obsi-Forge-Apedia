# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Create Your Character|Character]]: Board Your Starship
Take the ==[[AST_Starship|Starship]] command vehicle== asset card. This is your interstellar spacecraft. The default marked ability provides the basic functions of the ship. You can claim the other two abilities when you Advance. For now, leave them unmarked.


> [!tip] **Flying with Allies**
> If you are playing with allies, you share the [[AST_Starship|STARSHIP]]. You can put the asset in a place visible and accessible to everyone, or appoint one player to manage the card.
> If you are playing with others, discuss whether your characters are co-owners of the ship, or if one of you is the primary owner. Alternatively, the ship can belong to another person or faction, and you are its crew. This is just a narrative embellishment; it has no effect on how the asset is used in play. Anyone aboard can use the [[AST_Starship|Starship]] asset abilities.

## Flying Alone
If you are playing Starforged solo, you are a lone spacer in a vast galaxy. Thanks to automation and centralized controls, your starship is fully capable of flying and fighting while operated by a single pilot.

## Giving The Starship a History
Envision how you obtained or earned this ship. You can come up with your own origin, or roll or pick from the table below. If you use a result from the table, take a moment to consider and elaborate on the suggestion.

*108 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN*

## Envision The Starship
Your ship is an important aspect of your character, and a character in its own right. What does it look like? What makes it interesting or uniquely yours? Does it have any particular quirks? If nothing occurs to you now, you can flesh it out in play, or roll once or twice on the table below.

| dice: 1d100 | Starship Aspects |
|:---:|:--- |
| 1 – 5 | Engine room is scorched with old burn marks |
| 6 – 10 | Exterior is marred by rust and grime |
| 11 – 15 | Faint, phantom music sometimes echoes through the corridors |
| 16 – 20 | Gravity generator is notoriously fickle |
| 21 – 25 | Hull is fused with organic growths |
| 26 – 30 | Hull rattles and groans in atmospheric flight |
| 31 – 35 | Interior spaces are crowded with exposed cables and conduits |
| 36 – 40 | Looks defenseless, but exterior panels open to reveal weapons |
| 41 – 45 | Navigation logs contain coordinates to locations that do not, or should not, exist |
| 46 – 50 | Old bloodstain in the airlock reappears even when painted over |
| 51 – 55 | Once a beautiful ship, now scarred by a devastating battle |
| 56 – 60 | Patched hull covers a recent catastrophic breach |
| 61 – 65 | Placards and control labels are in an uncommon language |
| 66 – 70 | Removable plate decks provide access to hidden storage |
| 71 – 75 | Segmented landing gear unfold like gangly spider legs |
| 76 – 80 | Ship is powered by an ancient precursor device |
| 81 – 85 | Someone marked the hull with graffiti during a recent layover |
| 86 – 90 | Strange symbols are scrawled on the deck and bulkheads in the main corridor |
| 91 – 95 | Things tend to go missing for no logical reason |
| 96 – 100 | Timers and clocks are always just a bit off |

## Name Your Starship
Finally, give the ship a name, and write that name on the asset card. If you’re stuck for a name, roll on the [[SF_CH5_Starship-Name|Starship Name Oracle]], or just save it for later.
