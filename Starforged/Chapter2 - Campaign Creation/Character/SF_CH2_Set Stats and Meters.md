# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Create Your Character|Character]]: Set Stats and Meters
## Set Your Stats
Your character has five ==stats== that represent your capabilities, nature, and approach. Each is given a value from 1 to 3. When you make a move and roll dice, you usually add one of your stats to your action die. The move will tell you what stat to add, or will give you a choice. 

Your stats are: 
- ==Edge==: quickness, agility, and prowess when fighting at a distance. 
- ==Heart==: courage, willpower, empathy, sociability, and loyalty. 
- ==Iron==: physical strength, endurance, aggressiveness, and prowess when fighting at close quarters. 
- ==Shadow==: sneakiness, deceptiveness, and cunning. 
- ==Wits==: expertise, knowledge, and observation. 

**Arrange these values across your stats in any order: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1.** 

When setting your stats, consider the nature of your emerging character, and take a look at your assets to see if a stat is particularly useful. If you are an [[AST_Infiltrator|INFILTRATOR]], you would be well-served with a high value in shadow. If you are a [[AST_Diplomat|DIPLOMAT]], you may rely on your heart. If you are a [[AST_Gearhead|GEARHEAD]], you use your wits to craft and repair. 

> Stats represent your character’s inherent abilities, but they are also tied to your methods and personality. If you have a 3 in edge, you often rely on speed and precision in perilous situations—this is true whether you are firing a gun, moving on foot, or flying a starship

## Set Your Meters
Your ==condition meters== are on the left and right sides of your character sheet. You can use a paper clip or token to mark the current values.

First, set your health, spirit, and supply meters to 5.

Then, set your momentum to +2. Below the momentum meter, you’ll find boxes to write your max momentum and momentum reset. Set your max momentum to +10, and your momentum reset to +2.

Set the health of any companion assets to their max value, as shown on their asset cards.

Finally, set the integrity of your command vehicle and any support vehicles, as shown on their asset cards, to their max value; for your [[AST_Starship|STARSHIP]], this is 5
