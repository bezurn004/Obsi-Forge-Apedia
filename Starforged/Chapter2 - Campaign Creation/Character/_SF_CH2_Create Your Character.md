# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]]: Create Your Character
In _Starforged_, you undertake quests, overcome challenges, and explore the Forge through the perspective of your character. In this exercise, you’ll define some key aspects of that character and their starship. 

![[stopwatch_2quarters.svg|25]] **Allow about 20–30 minutes for this exercise.**
## What You Need
You’ll need a Starforged character sheet and a set of asset cards. 
- The ==character sheet== is used to track your stats, conditions, and experience. It’s included in the printable _Starforged Playkit_, available for download at ironswornrpg.com. Each player has their own character sheet. 
- ==Assets== represent notable traits and resources used by your character. They are formatted as printable or preprinted cards, available at ironswornrpg.com. If you are playing with others, one set of cards is enough for everyone at the table.

If you are using a digital tool to play _Starforged_, such as a virtual tabletop, take a moment to get familiar with the basic function of the character sheet on that platform. For now, you just need to know how to adjust your stats, fill out some basics such as your character’s name, and select your assets.

## Your Character's Scope
### Your Are Human
The people of the Forge are human. _Starforged_ does not directly provide options to play aliens, robots, uplifted animals, or other non-human characters. The actual mechanical aspects of your character are relatively light and can be themed to accommodate non-human entities, but _Starforged_ is primarily designed to be played from the perspective of a human being or a close analogue of a human being.

### Diversity and Inclusiveness
Apart from this human-centric assumption, envision your character as you like. There are no gameplay or setting restrictions that constrain your character’s race, culture, disabilities, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

If you are aiming to play a specific lived experience, don’t rely on assumptions or stereotypes. Put in the time to research and learn the experiences of others.
