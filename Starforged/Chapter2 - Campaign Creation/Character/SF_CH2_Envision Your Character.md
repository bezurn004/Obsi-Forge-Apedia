# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Create Your Character|Character]]: Envision Your Character
## Envision Appearance and Personality
Take a moment to envision their appearance and personality. 

To start, just define one or two facts for their physical look, how they act, and what they wear. You don’t need much detail at this stage, you can discover the nuances of your character through play.

For example: 
- **Look**: Covered in tattoos; has a mechanical leg adorned with art. 
- **Act**: Keen understanding of machines; often prefers them to people. 
- **Wear**: Safety goggles and dirty coveralls. 

Make note of these characteristics as you like, or just keep them in mind as you introduce your character.

## Name Your Character
Use your character sheet to give your character a ==name==. If you need inspiration for a name, use the [[SF_CH5_Character-Names|Character Names Oracle]].

Also note your character’s gender pronouns. This can include traditional pronouns such as he/him, she/her, and they/them, or non-traditional ones such as ze/zir.

Optionally, give your character a callsign. Spacers are typically known more by a ==callsign== than their actual name. In fact, they often refer to given and family names as “dirtside names.” A callsign might represent your reputation, or some incident or accomplishment in your past. If you’d like some inspiration, use the callsigns in the [[SF_CH5_Character-Names#Oracle: Character Call Sign|Character Names Oracle]]. If you don’t feel you’ve earned a callsign yet, leave it blank for now; perhaps you’ll gain one in the course of your story.
