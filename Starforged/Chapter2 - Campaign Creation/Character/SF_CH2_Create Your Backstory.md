# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Create Your Character|Character]]: Create Your Backstory
As you begin play in _Starforged_, your character is a person with few ties to others. The Forge is a vast galaxy, and your former home—if you had one—is lost to you, forsaken by you, or a distant memory.

Consider what happened to sunder or separate you from your home and relationships. This is your ==backstory==. This origin can influence the stories you explore and vows you undertake as you play _Starforged_, or it might just provide some texture to help bring your character to life.

Keep it simple. There’s no need to invent an elaborate history. You can discover more about your character through play.

## Backstory Oracle
For some backstory inspiration, roll or pick from the table below. Take a moment to elaborate on the suggestion. Or just leave it a bit vague and mysterious for now; you can flesh it out in play.

| dice: 1d100 | Backstory Prompt |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 – 7 | You abandoned your kin after learning a troubling truth |
| 8 – 13 | You are guided by a vision or prophecy |
| 14 – 20 | You are haunted by past actions or failures |
| 21 – 27 | You are running from a criminal past |
| 28 – 34 | You are the sole survivor of an attack or calamity |
| 35 – 40 | You escaped an abusive or unjust situation |
| 41 – 46 | You have no memory of your former life |
| 47 – 53 | You rejected a duty or destiny |
| 54 – 60 | You were banished from your former home |
| 61 – 67 | You were denied a birthright |
| 68 – 74 | You were on your own for as long as you can remember |
| 75 – 81 | You were sent away on a prolonged mission |
| 82 – 87 | You were taken or lured away by someone |
| 88 – 94 | Your ambitions outgrew your humble origins |

> [!tip] **Building a Backstory With Other Players**
> If you are playing with others, discuss your mutual history. Have you known one another for years, do you have only casual links, or are you only now forming a team as the campaign begins? Your backstories should not prohibit you from working with each other. You are allies with shared or complementary goals. A bit of friendly rivalry or friction between characters can make for good storytelling, but in the end you will stand together against those forces that would see your vows unfulfilled.

## Character Backstory Prompts From Truths
During the creation of the truths for the campaign, there are certain prompts to envision how your character relates to the Forge you have crafted. Review these truths and provide detail for how they relate to your character and the setting. Don't feel the need to provide an answer to all of these right away, as inspiration might come during play as new events and aspects of the truths are revealed.

| Truth | Backstory Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| [[SF_CH2_TR_Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]] | Do you possess a keepsake or artifact of pre-cataclysm society? What is it? Why is it important to you? |
| [[SF_CH2_TR_Exodus\|Exodus]] | Does your family or cultural history offer any stories of the Exodus? How does this legacy impact you today? |
| [[SF_CH2_TR_Iron\|Iron]] | What do you swear vows upon? Why is this object meaningful to you? |
| [[SF_CH2_TR_Magic\|Magic]] | If magic is an aspect of your setting, how does your character and their culture view these unnatural abilities? |
| [[SF_CH2_TR_Medicine\|Medicine]] | Do you bear any notable scars or prosthetics? Do you have any medical or physical disabilities? These aspects might influence your look or approach. |
| [[SF_CH2_TR_Precursors\|Precursors]] | Have you had any notable encounters with precursor vaults, relics, or tech? |
| [[SF_CH2_TR_Horrors\|Horrors]] | Have you experienced any supernatural encounters? |
