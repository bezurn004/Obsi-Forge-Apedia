# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Create Your Character|Character]]: Choose Path Assets
## ![[hexagon_white_num_1.svg|30]] Ready Asset Cards
At the top of each asset card, you’ll see a label indicating its type: ==command vehicle==, ==module==, ==support vehicle==, ==path==, ==companion==, or ==deed==.

First, separate the asset cards by type. Then, set aside the deed assets. Those aren’t available for a starting character, and aren’t needed for this exercise.

You’ll start by picking two paths for your character. See the next page for how that works.

*104 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN*

## ![[hexagon_white_num_2.svg|30]] Choose Two Paths
Choose any two path assets. Consider how each choice plays into an emerging concept for your character. 

Be mindful of the established truths from the last exercise. Some assets may not be a great fit for your setting. For example, if there is no magic or supernatural abilities, assets such as [[AST_Kinetic|Kinetic]], [[AST_Firebrand|Firebrand ]], and [[AST_Seer|Seer]] might be reimagined as a technological resource, or ignored altogether.

> [!tip] Picking Paths With Allies
> If you are playing _Starforged_ with others, take turns picking one path asset at a time. Discuss your choices as a group to help build an interesting team. Do not take an asset already chosen by another player.

## Need Inspiration?
If you want some direction for your starting paths, roll or pick from the table below and take the two paths associated with your selected background.

*105 CREATE YOUR CHARACTER*

## ![[hexagon_white_num_3.svg|30]] Choose Your Final Asset
%% #addition This section was pulled from later in the process to allow the player to choose the best time to choose their final asset.%%_At any time during the process, it is now time to pick one final asset. You may want to first [[SF_CH2_Create Your Backstory|Create Your Backstory]] to provide more purpose prior to choosing this asset.  On the flip side, choosing the asset now could help develop the narrative you weave when creating your character's backstory._

> [!tip] Shared Assets with Allies
> Modules and Support Vehicle assets are shared assets; a module’s abilities can benefit other player characters if it’s reasonable for them to make use of it; The person who selects a support vehicle might typically serve as the pilot or manage the asset. 

This time, you aren’t limited to picking a path. You can choose from any of these asset categories: 
- ==[[_Module Assets|Module]]==: Enhanced features or capabilities of your [[AST_Starship|STARSHIP]]. 
- ==[[_Vehicle Assets|Support Vehicle]]==: Secondary vehicles that your starship can carry and launch.
- ==[[_Companion Assets|Companion]]==: NPC helpers, including alien creatures and robots. 
- ==[[_Path Assets|Path]]==: Background aspects, careers, interests, training, and skills.

This asset, plus your two paths from earlier in this exercise, give your character a total of three starting assets along with your [[AST_Starship|STARSHIP]].
