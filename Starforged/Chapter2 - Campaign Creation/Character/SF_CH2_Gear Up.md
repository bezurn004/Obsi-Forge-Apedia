# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Create Your Character|Character]]: Gear Up
In _Starforged_, you won’t need a detailed list of equipment. Your supply meter is an abstract representation of your general readiness, clothes, fuel, energy, food, water, tools, weapons, ammo, mundane equipment, and financial resources. You are equipped and armed as appropriate to your vision for your character and the nature of your setting.

### Your Spacer Kit
You can assume you have access to some fundamental necessities necessary for space travel and exploration, either carried with you or stored on your ship. This is your ==spacer kit==. It includes:
- Sealed environment suit 
- Flashlights / headlamps 
- Toolkit 
- Medkit 
- Personal communicator 

## Personal Items
Make note of any equipment or personal items that represent an important aspect of your character’s approach, capabilities, or background. Keep this list short, around four or five items at most. The character sheet has space at the bottom to write down any notable gear. Losing important equipment or cherished items can be an outcome of a costly action or event in your story.

Your assets, in particular, can influence the gear you envision your character having at the ready. For example, you might be a [[AST_Tech|TECH]] with a well-used data pad for interfacing with systems and writing code. Or you might be a [[AST_Gunslinger|GUNSLINGER]] with a pair of heirloom pistols.

Also consider the object you swear iron vows upon. What is this object’s history, and why is it important to you?

> Your character is all set! In the next exercise, follow the prompts below to set the stage for your character to begin their adventures.
