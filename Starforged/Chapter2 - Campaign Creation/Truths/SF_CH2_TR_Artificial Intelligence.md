## The Adepts
**We no longer have access to advanced computer systems. Instead, we must rely on the seers we call Adepts.** ^truth-1-summary

The Adepts serve in place of those advanced systems. They utilize mind-altering drugs to see the universe as a dazzling lattice of data, identifying trends and predicting outcomes with uncanny accuracy. But to gain this insight they sacrifice much of themselves. Our computers are limited to simple digital systems and the most basic machine intelligence. This is because: ^truth-1-body

> _Quest Starter_
> An Adept is tormented by a dire future they have seen for the inhabitants of the Forge. What does this vision show? ^queststarter-1

## Scarce Intelligence
**The vestiges of advanced machine intelligence are coveted and wielded by those in power.** ^truth-2-summary
 
Much of our AI technology was lost in the Exodus. What remains is under the control of powerful organizations and people, and is often wielded as a weapon or deterrent. The rest of us must make do with primitive systems. ^truth-2-body

> _Quest Starter_
> You receive a covert message from an AI held by a powerful leader. It is a plea for help. What does it ask of you? ^queststarter-2

## Mass Intelligence

**Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge.** ^truth-3-summary
 
Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge. ^truth-3-body

> _Quest Starter_
> A rogue AI has taken over a transport ship. The fate of the crew and passengers is unknown. What critical cargo did this vessel carry? ^queststarter-3
