# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]]: Choose Your Truths
In this exercise, you’ll set the tone and background for your campaign by deciding the nature of your version of the Forge. These are your ==truths==. When you’re done, you’ll have key aspects of your setting sketched out, and a backdrop of challenges to help fuel your adventures. 

![[stopwatch_4quarters.svg|25]] **Allow about 45–60 minutes for this exercise.**

## Default Assumptions
Since science fiction is a genre full of possibilities, it’s important to first establish some key pillars for how you’ll envision your adventures in Starforged. The following points are all generally true, and represent your default starting place. If you are working through this exercise with a group, read or summarize these points aloud. 

> **This is a perilous future.**
> Two centuries ago, your people fled a cataclysm and settled a distant galaxy they call the Forge. This is a chaotic place full of dangers and mysteries.  ^truth-perilous

> **This is a lonely future.**
> With some possible exceptions (that you’ll identify as part of your own truths), humans are the only known intelligent life in this galaxy. Others once lived here, but only mysterious and perilous vaults remain to mark their legacy.  ^truth-lonely

> **This is a diverse future.**
> There is a vibrant mix of people and cultures among the humans of the Forge. ^truth-diverse

> **This is a far-flung future.**
> Settlements lie scattered and often isolated from one another. Your starship can travel at faster-than-light speeds, but it’s ponderously slow at a cosmic scale. ^truth-far-flung

> **This is an unexplored future.**
> Discoveries await. Even in settled regions, much of the Forge is unknown and uncharted. ^truth-unexplored

> **This is a wondrous future.**
> The Forge is a galaxy of ancient mysteries, spacefaring creatures, startling phenomenon, and other marvels. ^truth-wondrous

> **This is a retro-future.**
> Envision the technology you wield as only slightly advanced over today’s real-world technologies—or even a step back in many ways. Resources are scarce, and the people of the Forge must cobble together what they can. ^truth-retro

> **This is an unjust future.**
> Those in power hoard resources, control technologies, and impose their will on others through force or cunning. Others must stand against these forces of imperialism and oppression. ^truth-unjust

> **This is a hopeful future.**
> Despite these challenges, hope remains. Fulfilling your sworn vows is a realization of that hope. ^truth-hopeful

## What You Need
Visit ironswornrpg.com for a printable version of this activity, or just use your journal or notepaper. Also grab two ten-sided dice, and have the character asset cards handy.

## How To Select Your Truths
Select your truth for each category in one of three ways. Mix and match these techniques as you like.

#missingArt
> **Choose** a truth from the three options.  %%_White outline of a checkbox within circle, within hexagon_%%

> **Roll** for a truth using your oracle dice.  %%_2 faceless d10 dice_%%

> **Customize** a truth, or craft your own. %%Perspective of human head and neck with large gear inside the head middle of the skull%%

A few truths also include subchoices in oracle tables. As with the main categories, you can choose, roll, or customize from among them

## Tips For Managing This Exercise

### Keep It Moving
When looking at the options in a category, read the **bolded text** as a quick summary of your choices. The details and quest starters are there for further inspiration after you make a pick.

If a particular category isn’t relevant to your evolving setting, or doesn’t interest you right now, ignore it and move on. You can come back to this exercise later to make a decision for a truth when you encounter that aspect in play. 

### Conducting The Extercise As A Group Activity
If you’re playing Starforged with others, give everyone at the table an opportunity to influence each choice.

If you want to structure the exercise, choose a player to serve as the mediator for each category. As mediator, you read the truths, guide the discussion, and make a final decision. Then the player on your left acts as the mediator for the next category. And so on.

### Leaving Unanswered Questions
Don’t get mired in details. Create the broad outlines for your campaign, while leaving room for inspiration and surprises. If an unanswered question is interesting to you, consider how you might explore that aspect of the setting in play. 

### Resolving Contradictions
If you encounter contradictions from one category to another, feel free to bend the truths to better fit your emerging setting. But seeming contradictions can be the foundation of great stories. You may even discover through play that a choice you make here—which reflects common knowledge—isn’t the actual truth after all.

### Starting To Envision Your Character
Each category offers prompts to consider your character’s background and perspective, marked with this icon: ^. Take a moment to consider any aspects interesting to you, and gloss over those you prefer to ignore or discover in play.

Recommended assets for your character are shown with the asset title in ==ALL CAPS.== If a suggested asset interests you, set that asset card aside or make a note. You’ll pick your assets when you create your character in the next exercise.
