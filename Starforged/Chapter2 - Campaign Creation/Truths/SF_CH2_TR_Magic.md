## Techno-Force
**Magic does not exist.** ^truth-1-summary

Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge’s energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure. ^truth-3-body
