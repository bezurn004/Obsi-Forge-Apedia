## Lawless Forge
**Much of the settled domains are a lawless frontier. Criminal factions and corrupt leaders often hold sway.** ^truth-1-summary
 
Powers rise and fall in the Forge, so any authority is fleeting. In the end, we must fend for ourselves. A few communities are bastions of successful autonomy, but many are corrupted or preyed upon by petty despots, criminals, and raiders. ^truth-1-body

> _Quest Starter_
> In the upper atmosphere of a gas giant, transport vehicles carry valuable and volatile fuel from the processing plant to a heavily guarded storage depot. The notorious leader of a criminal organization needs this fuel, and gives you the schedule for the transports. What leverage does this person hold over you? How will you undertake this heist? ^queststarter-1

## Bounty Authority
**Laws and governance vary across settled domains, but bounty hunters are given wide latitude to pursue their contracts. Their authority is almost universally recognized, and supersedes local laws.** ^truth-2-summary
 
Through tradition and influence, bounty hunter guilds are given free rein to track and capture fugitives in most settled places. Only the foolish stand between a determined bounty hunter and their target. ^truth-2-body

> _Quest Starter_
> A famed bounty hunter needs your help tracking down their quarry. What is your relationship to the fugitive? Do you swear to aid the hunter, or the target? ^queststarter-2

## The Covenant
**Our communities are bound under the terms of the Covenant, a charter established after the Exodus. The organization called the Keepers is sworn to uphold those laws.** ^truth-3-summary
 
Most settlements are still governed under the Covenant and yield to the authority of the Keepers. But a few view the Covenant as a dogmatic, impractical, and unjust relic of our past; in those places, the Keepers find no welcome. ^truth-3-body

> _Quest Starter_
> A Keeper abuses their authority to take control of a settlement, and rules with an iron fist. What do they seek to gain there? ^queststarter-3
