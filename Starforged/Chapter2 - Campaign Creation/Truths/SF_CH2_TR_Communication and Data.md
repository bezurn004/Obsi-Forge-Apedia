## Dark Data Age
**Much was lost when we came to the Forge. It is a dark age.** ^truth-1-summary
 
The knowledge that remains is a commodity as valuable as the rarest resource. Information is collected, hoarded, and jealously guarded. Ships and outposts endure prolonged periods of isolation, and rumors or disinformation are used to gain advantage or undermine foes. ^truth-1-body

> _Quest Starter_
> An insurgent faction seeks to make knowledge available to all. To that end, they ask your aid in stealing important data from an outpost belonging to a corrupt organization. What information is held there? Why is it also important to you? ^queststarter-1

## Data Couriers
**Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements.** ^truth-2-summary
 
Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination. ^truth-2-body

> _Quest Starter_
> You discover a crippled courier ship. The pilot, carrying a critical and time-sensitive message, is dead. Where was the message bound, and why do you swear to see it to its destination? ^queststarter-2

## Data Weave
**In settled domains, a network of data hubs called the Weave allow near-instantaneous communication and data-sharing between ships and outposts.** ^truth-3-summary
 
Because of their importance, Weave hubs are often targets for sabotage, and communication blackouts are not uncommon. Beyond the most populous sectors, travelers and outposts are still commonly isolated and entirely off the grid. ^truth-3-body

> _Quest Starter_
> After years of isolation, the launch of a new data hub will connect several outposts to the Weave. But a person or faction seeks to stop it. What do they hope to gain by keeping those settlements in the dark? Why are you sworn to stop them? ^queststarter-3
