# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]]: Prepare for Liftoff
In this chapter, you’ll launch your _Starforged_ campaign by deciding the truths of your setting, creating a character, generating a starting location, and swearing an iron vow to undertake a perilous quest. These guided exercises will walk you through each step of the process. 

### Prep is Play
_Starforged_ is designed for jump-in gameplay. Whether you are playing solo, teaming up with other players for a co-op campaign, or facilitating a game as the guide, you don’t need to prepare for a session. Instead, you can pick up where you left off and play to see what happens.

These exercises are the exception. Using them, you create a foundation of setting, character, and narrative opportunities. Then, you build on that foundation through play. This initial investment of time and creative energy is narrative momentum for your imagined world.

Also, here’s a secret: You’re already playing the game. What you’ll do through the course of these exercises, make decisions based on established fiction, consult oracles, interpret creative prompts, envision people, places, and situations—is all part of playing _Starforged_.

In short, these exercises should be fun. They should spark your creativity. They should make you excited about diving into the world you’ve created. If anything feels like work, skip it or take a shortcut and move on. 

### Returning to an Existing Campaign
If you completed these exercises previously and are returning to an established setting with a new character, you can shortcut or ignore many of the exercises in this chapter. Instead, get started by [[_SF_CH2_Create Your Character|jumping to the character creation summary]] for a recap of character creation. Then, if you have an inciting incident and initial quest in mind, you’re all set! Otherwise, go to [[_SF_CH2_Begin Your Adventure|Starting Your Adventure]] for advice on beginning your adventure. 

### Introducing a New Player
If you are introducing a new player to an existing campaign, you can use the [[SF_CH2_Choose Your Truths|Truths exercise]] truths exercise to help summarize the nature of your setting. While you are doing this, make note of any truths that have evolved through play. If there are open questions or unexplored aspects of your campaign, use the exercise to give the new player a role in fleshing out those truths. Collaborate with them to identify aspects of the setting they might want to explore.
