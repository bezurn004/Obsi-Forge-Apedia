# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Begin Your Adventure|Adventure]]: Swearing the First Vow
## ![[hexagon_white_num_2.svg|35]] Set the Scene
Based on the nature of your inciting incident, where will you begin your story? Are you in the depths of space, about to encounter some new mystery or danger? Are you at the settlement you detailed in the previous exercise, ready to take on an urgent sworn mission?

Whatever the location, you have two options for starting play: You can begin with a ==prologue==, or ==in medias res==.

### Starting with a Prologue
Jumping in with a prologue can help flesh out who you are and how you interact with your world. For example, imagine arriving at a settlement. Envision your starship settling onto a docking pad. See your character as they emerge. Why are you there? Where do you go? How do you interact with the inhabitants? Think of this as the sequence in a television show or movie before the credits roll. If you have a question about the location or the people there, [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]].

> [!tip] **Group Play**
> If you are playing with allies the prologue is an opportunity to roleplay your relationships and introduce your personality and backgrounds. Play out a scene or two of your mundane day-to-day interactions. This is the calm before the storm.

Then, when the time is right, introduce the inciting incident to help drive your story forward.

> If you didn’t think of an inciting incident, or aren’t particularly excited about it, you can also use the prologue to jump in and discover a dramatic situation through play. Introduce your character and allies going about their usual business. Ask questions about other characters, your setting, and the current situation. Draw conclusions to those questions or [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]]. Look for opportunities in the fiction to trigger a vow.

### Starting in Medias Res
In medias res is a Latin term meaning “in the middle of things.” You start your story at a crucial point. Your inciting incident is happening now, or is an imminent threat. Raider ships appear on the settlement’s radar. A marauding creature attacks. The battered tradeship calls for help.

You can begin with a tense, action-oriented scene as you encounter the problem. Or you might frame the scene where you immediately swear a vow and commit to this quest, letting the result of that move trigger what happens next.

Either way, when it’s time to [[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow|Swear an Iron Vow (move)]] to the next heading.

*131 BEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE*

## ![[hexagon_white_num_3.svg|35]] Make the Move
To set your quest in motion, as a response to the inciting incident, make this move.

> [!example]  SWEAR AN IRON VOW
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^trigger]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^action-roll]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^strong-hit]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^weak-hit]]
> ![[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow#^miss]]

### Envision The Vow
First, start with the fiction. This is an important moment for your character and your story. You stand at the threshold of new adventures and perils. You are about to bind yourself to a sacred promise. What iron totem do you hold? What do you say?

> [!tip] **Swearing the Vow with Allies**
> If you are playing with allies, one of you makes the [[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow|Swear an Iron Vow (move)]]. Whomever is most connected to this quest, or is at the forefront of the incident, should swear the vow. Other players can make the [[SF_CH3_Aid Your Ally|Aid Your Ally (move)]] as a way of representing their own commitment to this quest, but keep in mind that more moves mean more opportunities for failure. For the purposes of starting your campaign, it might be best to focus on the single move and let others portray their actions in the fiction of the scene.

### Write the Vow
You and your allies will mark the vow on your vow worksheet or journal. Write the name of the vow and give it a rank. Since this is a starting vow, hopefully dealt with in a session or two of playtime, give it a rank of troublesome or dangerous.

Then, turn to the next heading to roll the dice and resolve the move.

*132 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN*

## Rolling the Dice
Grab your action die (one six-sided die) and challenge dice (two ten-sided dice) and roll them all at once.

Add the value of your heart stat to the action die. If you are swearing this vow to your connection (created in the previous exercise), add +1. If you have any assets with a bonus for this move, add those as well. The total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is your action score.

Compare the action score to the value of the challenge dice. 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ![[outcome-strong-hit.svg\|80]] | **If your action score beats both challenge dice,** you scored a strong hit. Take +2 momentum. You are confident. Your next steps are clear. Envision what this means in the context of the situation, and play to see what happens. |
| ![[outcome-weak-hit.svg\|80]] | **If your action score beats only one of the challenge dice,** you scored a weak hit. Take +1 momentum. You are hesitant or anxious. Your next steps are unclear. This will typically lead to new scenes and new moves as you try to gain a foothold or uncover more about the situation. |
| ![[outcome-miss.svg\|80]] | **If your action score doesn’t beat either challenge die,** you scored a miss. An unexpected danger or obstacle stands in your way. Envision what it is, or Ask the Oracle. Then, play to see what happens as you attempt to overcome this stumbling block. |

*133 BEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE*

## ![[hexagon_white_num_4.svg|35]] Next Steps
Depending on the result of the [[SF_CH3_Swear an Iron Vow|Swear an Iron Vow (move)]], you may have a clear path forward, more questions than answers, or may need to overcome an immediate obstacle or threat. Envision what the outcome means and how you respond.

And then, play. Ask and answer questions about the situations, people, creatures, and places you encounter. When you’re unsure, [[SF_CH3_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]]. When you do something or encounter something within the scope of a move, make that move.

At first, you might be a bit confused. You might make mistakes. That’s okay. You’ll find your footing soon enough. Keep your reference sheets handy. If you have a question about a specific term in a move or asset, check out the [[GSRY_Definitions]]. If you have a more involved rules question, make a call and move on. You can look up the answer later using the details in the next chapter.

For now, you are Ironsworn.

You’ve forged a galaxy.

Make your mark upon it.
