# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Begin Your Adventure|Adventure]]: The Inciting Incident
An ==inciting incident== is the problem at the beginning of a story that propels the protagonists into action. Everything up to that point is backstory. It is the inciting incident that begins your campaign.

At this point, you may already have a problem or mission in mind for the start of your campaign. If so, jump to [[SF_CH2_First Vow#Set the Scene|Setting the Scene]].

If not, consider the narrative fodder from the previous exercises. 
**Truths: **
- **Selected truths:** Which factions, conflicts, or dangers offer an opportunity for adventure? 
- **Quest starters:** Did any of the quest starters associated with your truths jump out at you as inspiration for your adventures? 

**Character:** 
- **Paths:** Does your character have any duties, skills, or goals that lend themselves to a quest? 
- **Backstory:** Does your backstory imply an immediate danger or goal that must be dealt with? 
- **Starship:** Is your ship in need of anything? Does its history create trouble for you? 
- **Team:** If playing co-op, do you and your allies have any shared or complementary goals? 

**Sector: **
- **Settlements:** Are there any settlement aspects, projects, or troubles that create an opportunity for a quest?
- **Connection:** Based on their role or goal, does your connection need something from you? 
- **Sector trouble:** Does the trouble in this sector, or some aspect of it, need to be dealt with?

## What Make a Good Inciting Incident
Consider these suggestions for a compelling initial quest: 
- **Make it personal:** Why is this important to your character? Envision how this connects to your background, skills, and motivations. Most tasks are unworthy of a sworn vow. What makes this different? 
- **Make it a problem that won’t go away on its own:** The threats or forces at the heart of this situation will see it through, even if you ignore them. 
- **Give it a ticking clock:** The problem won’t wait for you. If you don’t act, things will get worse or fall out of reach. 
- **Up the stakes:** If the quest seems too mundane, envision factors that make the inciting incident more interesting or complex. 
- **Limit the scope:** Don’t try to save the universe out of the gate. Envision a trouble or goal that seems manageable—something you can overcome in a session or two of play. 

> [!tip] **Allies and the Inciting Incident**
> If you are playing with others, you will undertake this quest together as a ==shared vow==. Discuss your ideas for the incident, and consider how the quest fits the nature of your team.

Embellish or adjust the result in the context of your established character and setting. Be mindful of the best practices on [[#What Make a Good Inciting Incident|the previous page]]. Make it relevant to your character and worthy of a sworn vow. Make it dramatic and interesting. But this will be a lower-ranked quest, so keep it relatively straightforward, things may very well spin out of control on their own soon enough.
