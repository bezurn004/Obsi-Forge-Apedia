%% #addition Flavor text for combined steps on this page %%_After setting up a starting sector follow these steps to flesh out the sector for a compelling story to begin your adventures._

## ![[hexagon_white_num_6.svg|35]] Create a Sector Map
Your sector worksheet includes space to draw a map of the sector.

One important note: Keep it simple. The Forge is vast. Dense stellar clouds, complex star systems, and chaotic energy storms make charting and navigation difficult. As you explore the galaxy, you’ll mark down important locations such as settlements or interesting discoveries. Everything else is abstracted or ignored.

> Sector maps are helpful for planning and tracking your adventures and discoveries, but are absolutely not required. If you prefer to ignore them, or keep travel looser and more abstract, feel free.

To start, arrange your settlements on the map however you like. The grid isn’t meant to track literal distances, but can be used as an abstract representation of whether locations are clustered together or remote from one another. Dots or circles for settlements work fine, or utilize your own visual cues for location types. %% #addition Changed the icons to match the mermaid diagram symbols%% _In the example below, an orbital settlement is a circle a planetside settlement is a cylinder, and a deep space settlement is a double sided rectangle.

## ![[hexagon_white_num_7.svg|35]] Create Passages
Next, you’ll set the ==passages== for this sector. A passage is a charted route among the drifts. Spacers rely on these routes for travel and trade. Think of it like using a GPS and freeways to drive to a distant city, as compared to traveling with only vague directions on unmarked roads.

From a gameplay perspective, following a passage allows you to resolve the outcome of a perilous journey with a single roll of the dice using the [[SF_CH3_Set a Course|Set a Course (move)]]. It makes it easier to manage your resources, and shifts the focus of your story to what happens at your destination.

If you are traveling uncharted paths through space, you instead [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]]. This gives the journey and its perils greater focus. In exchange, you [[SF_CH3_Earn Experience|Earn Experience (move)]] for a successful expedition. Plus, you’ll create a new passage that you (and perhaps others) can use to speed your way along the same path in the future. 

To learn more about passages, see [[SF_CH1_Navigating the Forge|Navigating the Forge (gameplay)]].  Next will be to mark the passages for your starting sector.

*120 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN*

### Set the Number of Passages
How many passages are in your sector? In the normal course of your game, learning about passages and acquiring navigational data might be challenges to be overcome. For the starting sector, assume the following number of passages.

| Sector Region | Number of Passages |
| --- | --- |
| Terminus | 3 |
| Outlands | 2 |
| Expanse | 1 |
^table-sector-passages-per-region

### Mark Passages on the Map
Draw the passages as lines on your sector map. Each passage must do one of two things: 
- Connect two settlements. 
- Connect a settlement to the edge of your sector map (leading to another sector).

In this example for a sector in the Outlands, we’ve drawn a passage between Amity and Bleakhold. The second passage leads from Bleakhold to another sector (as indicated by the arrow). The Osiris settlement is not connected by a passage. This might mean its location is uncertain, the data for the passage is not openly shared, or a previous passage has been undone by chaotic changes within the Forge. You could travel to Osiris from Amity or Bleakhold, but it would require that you [[SF_CH3_Undertake an Expedition|Undertake an Expedition (move)]] to trailblaze a new route.

*121 BUILD A STARTING SECTOR*

## ![[hexagon_white_num_8.svg|35]] Zoom In On a Settlement
It will be helpful to have some additional detail for one of the settlements in your starting sector. You might begin the campaign in the midst of a layover, or are just arriving there as your story opens.

Choose one of the settlements in your starting sector, whichever is most interesting to you. Then return to the settlement oracles and roll on the following:
- [[SF_CH5_Settle-Creation|Settlement Location]]
- [[SF_CH5_Settle-Creation#Settlement Population|Settlement Population]]
- [[SF_CH5_Settle_Approach#Oracle: Settlement First Look|Settlement First Look]] roll 1–2 times 
- [[SF_CH5_Settle-Concerns|Settlement Trouble]]

> Some results may refer you to another oracle, as indicated by an arrow symbol (▶). For example, if you roll ▶Action + Theme on the Settlement Trouble table, you’ll roll again on the [[SF_CH5_Core_Action-Theme|Action/Theme Oracle]] to generate an abstract creative prompt.

If the settlement is planetside or in orbit, you can also expand your understanding of that planet. Go to the appropriate planet type [[_SF_CH5_Planets|Planet Oracles]], and roll on the following tables: 
- **Atmosphere**
- **Observed from Space**; roll 1–2 times 
- **Planetside Feature**; roll 1–2 times 

If the planet is a Vital World, also roll on the **Diversity** and **Biomes** tables.

Don’t roll on the planet’s settlement table. To keep things simple for now, we’ll assume there’s one inhabited settlement.

*122 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN*

## ![[hexagon_white_num_10.svg|35]] Introduce a Sector Trouble
You’ve heard rumors of a sector-wide peril, conflict, or mystery. You may come up with a trouble appropriate to your setting and character, roll on the [[SF_CH5_Core_Action-Theme|Action/Theme Oracle]] for inspiration, or pick or roll on the table below. Envision how this trouble might manifest, and make note of it on your sector worksheet or journal.

| dice: 1d100 | Sector Trouble |
|:---:|:--- |
| 1 – 5 | Blockade prevents trade with other sectors |
| 6 – 10 | Bounty hunters search for an infamous fugitive |
| 11 – 15 | Chaotic breaches in spacetime spread like wildfire |
| 16 – 20 | Criminal faction corrupts local authorities |
| 21 – 25 | Devastating superweapon has fallen into the wrong hands |
| 26 – 30 | Energy storms are rampant |
| 31 – 35 | Magnetic disturbances disrupt communication |
| 36 – 40 | Newly found resource lures greedy fortune hunters to the sector |
| 41 – 45 | Notorious pirate clan preys on starships |
| 46 – 50 | Parasitic lifeforms spread like a plague |
| 51 – 55 | Precursor sites throughout the sector emit strange signals |
| 56 – 60 | Prophecies foretell an imminent awakening of a dreadful power |
| 61 – 65 | Raider clan emerges as a dominant threat under a new leader |
| 66 – 70 | Religious zealots overrun the sector |
| 71 – 75 | Rogue AI infiltrates systems throughout the sector |
| 76 – 80 | Settlements or factions are on the brink of war |
| 81 – 85 | Ships regularly go missing |
| 86 – 90 | Sickness spreads among ships and settlements |
| 91 – 95 | Supernova is imminent |
| 96 – 100 | Titanic spaceborne lifeform stalks the spaceways |

## ![[hexagon_white_num_11.svg|35]] Finalize The Starting Sector
Give your sector a name. If you’d like a suggestion, roll on the [[SF_CH5_Sector-Name|Sector Name Oracle]]. Write the name on your sector worksheet.

You can also set a controlling power for the sector if a faction came to the forefront during the truth’s exercise. If not, keep it ambiguous. Sectors can be isolated, chaotic, or home to many insignificant factions. If you want to reveal details of a faction during play, use the [[_SF_CH5_Factions|Factions Oracles]] for inspiration.

> Your starting sector is done! As you explore space and visit settlements, you’ll add additional detail. If you skipped this exercise, see the next page for a sample sector. Otherwise, follow the prompts below to continue to campaign creation process.
