# [[_Starforged|Starforged]] - [[_SF_CH2_Contents|Campaign]] - [[_SF_CH2_Build a Starting Sector|Sector]]: Create a Local Connection
A ==connection== represents an important relationship with a non-player character (NPC). You will create connections with NPCs, advance those relationships through the course of your narrative, and forge bonds to represent deeper connections. Building and nurturing these relationships will allow you to mark progress on your bonds legacy track and gain experience. Connections also offer narrative benefits appropriate to their role, and can support your actions with a mechanical bonus.

For now, you have a single connection in the starting sector. You almost certainly know other people, here and elsewhere, but you aren’t truly connected to those people or they aren’t a focus of your story. You can formalize other relationships by making them a connection through the course of your adventures.

> [!tip] Sharing a Connection
> If you are playing with others, you will create a single connection as part of this exercise. This will be a shared connection. Whether through introductions or collective interactions, each of you has a link to this person. Consider how they fit into the background for your team. 

## Make the Move
Take a look at the [[SF_CH3_Make a Connection|Make a Connection (move)]]. Instead of rolling, assume an automatic strong hit. This connection is already established as you begin your campaign, so no roll is necessary.

## Give the Connection A Role
Your connection’s role represents their duty, expertise, or background.
For example: 
- A **shipwright** builds and repairs starships.
- An **envoy** can arrange introductions or help resolve disputes. 
- An **explorer** has delved the depths of the Forge and knows many of its secrets.

> Connections are not shipmates or companions. They are independent characters whose own lives occasionally intersect with your own. You might accompany the connection on a specific mission, but you’ll soon part ways as your duties and ambitions take you on separate paths.

Here’s a few tips on creating a role for your connection: 
- The connection’s role can be inspired by your character’s background and recent history. Are they the **doctor** who found you in a crashed ship and nursed you back to health? Are they the **spymaster** who will task you with missions in this sector? 
- Consider making the role specific and nuanced. A role such as **xenoarchaeologist** is more inspiring than **researcher**. **Spice trader** is more evocative than **merchant**. This specificity will make their role less broadly useful for you, but will inspire more interesting stories. 
- It’s okay if a connection’s role doesn’t provide an obvious benefit for your character. The narrative purpose of the relationship might be to introduce situations where you will help them. For example, a **farmer** on a backwater world would likely face native wildlife, raiders, natural disasters, and more. Will you swear iron vows to stand with them?

If you want to leave it in the hands of fate, generate a random role using the [[SF_CH5_Character-Drives#Oracle: Character Role|Character Role Oracle]]. Elaborate on the answer as appropriate to your setting.

> Use the connections worksheet to record the details of this connection. Start by marking down their first role.

## Give the Connection a Rank
Your connection’s rank represents the challenge of advancing the relationship. The higher the rank, the greater the narrative focus and time required to eventually Forge a Bond with them.

Choose a rank appropriate to their role and the level of involvement you want them to have in your story: troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic. For a starting connection, consider making them troublesome or dangerous. Mark their rank on the connections worksheet.

Keep in mind that terms such as dangerous don’t describe the nature of this person. Rather, they define the potential risks and costs associated with the relationship. That said, it’s entirely appropriate to create a connection who is also an antagonist. The threads that bind are sometimes frayed.

## Define Their Characteristics
Give the connection a few distinctive attributes. You can simply envision what you know of this person, or roll on the following character oracle tables: 
- [[SF_CH5_Character-Approach#Oracle Character First Look {1-2}|First Look Oracle]]; roll 1–2 times 
- [[SF_CH5_Character-Drives#Oracle: Character Goal|Character Goal]]; roll 1 time
- [[SF_CH5_Character-Drives#Oracle Character Revealed Aspect {1-3}|Revealed Aspect Oracle]]; roll 1–2 times

Make note of anything interesting in your journal or connections worksheet.

## Choose the Connection's Home
Choose a settlement in your sector as the connection’s home. If you’d like to get them involved in your story right away, place them at the settlement you detailed in [[SF_CH2_Enhance A Starting Sector#Zoom In On a Settlement|Step 8: Zoom In On A Settlement]]. Mark it down on the connections worksheet.

## Give The Connection A Name
Give your connection a name or callsign. If you need inspiration, roll on the [[SF_CH5_Character-Names|Character Names Oracle]]. Make note of this identity on the connections worksheet.

## Interacting With Your Connection
Depending on the connection’s role and the whims of narrative events, they might serve as a regular patron or associate in your story, or as an infrequent acquaintance. As you interact, you can find opportunities to [[SF_CH3_Develop a Relationship|Develop a Relationship (move)]] and eventually [[SF_CH3_Forge a Bond|Forge a Bond (move)]] with them. Meanwhile, whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, you may add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
