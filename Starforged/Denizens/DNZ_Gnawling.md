## Description
The bane of all spacers, the cable-chewing vermin known as gnawlings are a common pest aboard starships throughout the Forge. Adept at navigating in low or zero gravity with their long, multi-jointed limbs, these creatures emerge from cargo holds and engineering bays to gather and consume food. It’s said a gnawling could digest an eidolon drive, and there’s some truth to that adage, their digestive systems barely differentiate between organic and inorganic material.

Though not a grave threat individually, if left to their own devices, gnawlings are capable of quickly overrunning even large vessels. More than a few horror stories exist of scavengers cracking the airlock seal on a derelict only to find it crawling with thousands of these vile, chittering things.

Glowcats are a common gnawling deterrent, employed aboard cargo ships to keep the vermin at bay.

## Variants
### Variant: Gnawling Brood Mother
**Rank: ** Formidable: (3)

These mutated creatures often dwell at the heart of a rampant gnawling infestation. They are many times the size of a gnawling, and protect their nest and broodlings with savage cunning.

### Quest Starter
> An orbital settlement is overrun by gnawlings and abandoned. What precious thing still lies within? Why are you sworn to retrieve it from this infested place? ^QuestStarter
