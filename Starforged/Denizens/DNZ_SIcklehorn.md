## Description
The sicklehorn are mammalian herd animals bred by settlers throughout the Forge. They are adaptable to most climates and terrain, have iron constitutions, and are prized for the versatile and valuable milk produced by their females. Aside from its nutritive properties, the milk can be processed in a number of ways to manufacture potent medicines and powerful narcotics.

A herd of sicklehorn are often sent with groups attempting to found a new planetside settlement. With careful breeding, the settlers can produce enough meat and milk to sustain themselves and trade for needed supplies. But sicklehorn are range animals, and raiders and rustlers often target a vulnerable herd. The creatures—especially a matriarch—are a valuable commodity.

## Variants
### Variant: Sicklehorn Stampede
**Rank: ** Formidable: (3)

Sicklehorns are gentle-natured, but when startled or facing a threat, they will stampede as a group. A herd of charging sicklehorn can run at incredible speeds over the most rugged of terrain, laying waste to anything in its path.

### Quest Starter
> A settlement’s prized sicklehorn matriarch has been stolen, the herd is in disarray, and the settlers won’t survive another year without her return. The theft is blamed on a rival settlement on the same planet, but raiders also plague this sector. How are you involved? ^QuestStarter
