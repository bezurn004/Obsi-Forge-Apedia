## Description
The howlcat dwells in the shadows below the canopy of a verdant jungle world. It has a lean, powerful form, is armed with curving claws and fangs, and moves unseen through the half-light of the jungle thanks to its sleek, blue-gray fur.

Unnervingly, the howlcat’s heavy skull possesses no eyes. Instead, it is crowned by large ears and a glossy bioacoustic organ. Through its distinct, chilling call, it uses echolocation to perceive its surroundings and stalk its prey with uncanny precision.

If you find yourself hunted by a howlcat, beware the moment when its calls fall silent; it is about to strike.

## Variants
### Variant: Howlcat Pack
**Rank: ** Formidable: (3)

Though deadly on its own, the howlcat usually hunts in a pack of three or four of its kind. Prowling through the jungle, a pack of howlcats can surround and overwhelm their prey with lethal prowess, coordinating their attacks via shrill calls.

### Quest Starter
> A long-abandoned settlement, now reclaimed by the jungle, holds something of value or importance. But there is no clear landing site near the settlement, and the surrounding lands are home to a pack of fearsome howlcats. What is it you seek in that forsaken place, and how will you avoid becoming a howlcat’s next meal? ^QuestStarter
