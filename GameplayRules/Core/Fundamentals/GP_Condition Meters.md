# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Condition Meters
Along the right side of your character sheet are three condition meters: health, spirit, and supply. These measure your character’s readiness and status. As with the momentum meter, you can use a paperclip or token to mark the current values. These meters may rise and fall throughout a typical session. Their values are reduced when you face hardship through a suffer move (page 198), and increased when you make recover moves (page 208). 

## Health
Health represents your current physical condition and stamina, ranked from 0 to 5. Health is reduced when you Endure Harm, and increased when you rest or receive care through moves such as Heal. If you are at 0 health, scoring a miss when you Endure Harm puts you at risk of suffering an ==impact (page 50) or dying.== 

## Spirit
Spirit is your current morale and mental state, ranked from 0 to 5. Spirit is reduced when you Endure Stress. It is increased when you find comfort in companionship or relaxed moments through moves such as Hearten. If you are at 0 spirit, scoring a miss when you Endure Stress puts you at risk of suffering an impact or falling into desolation.

## Supply 
Supply represents your preparedness, including food, water, fuel, weapons, ammo, equipment, cargo, money, and general upkeep. Supply is ranked from 0 to 5. It is decreased when you make the Sacrifice Resources move, and is increased when you Resupply to fortify your provisions and readiness. If you need to know if you have a specific item or resource at hand, make the Check Your Gear move. When you Sacrifice Resources and your supply falls to 0, you must ==mark unprepared (page 50). ==

### Supply and Allies
If you are playing with others, the supply meter represents the shared resources among your party. You and your allies use the same supply value while you travel together. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer the result of an outcome that forces you to Sacrifice Resources, each of you adjust your supply meter accordingly. If anyone must mark unprepared, everyone marks unprepared.

## Asset Condition Meters
Several assets have their own condition meters. 
- Your STARSHIP and other vehicles have an integrity meter (seen here at the bottom of this asset card) to measure their condition. When your vehicle faces a damaging situation, make the Withstand Damage move. To get a vehicle back up to speed, make the Repair move. 
- Companion assets have a health meter that is reduced when you make the Companion Takes a Hit move. Their health is increased through the Heal move when you treat them or obtain treatment—or using the Repair move for mechanical companions. 
- Some assets have a unique condition meter for a specialized resource. For example, if you are a FIREBRAND, you have a fire meter and tap into that inner source to unleash destructive energies. To track the value of a condition meter on an asset card, make a mark, or use a paperclip or token. You can also set a six-sided die on top of the card and rotate it to show the current value. The value of a meter cannot exceed the maximum shown on the card. Learn more about assets starting on page 54. 

## Action Rolls and Condition Meters
Some moves prompt you to make an action roll using the value of a condition meter instead of a stat. For example, when you Check Your Gear, the move tells you to “roll +supply.” When you see an action framed as “roll +[condition meter],” use the value of that meter in your action roll as if it were a stat. 

Some assets allow you to use the value of a condition meter as an add for your action roll, phrased as “add +[condition meter].” This is a boost to your action score in addition to your stat, rather than a replacement for the stat.
