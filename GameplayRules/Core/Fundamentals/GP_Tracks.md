## Progress Tracks
A progress track measures your headway against a goal or obstacle, and is used to resolve whether you ultimately succeed or fail against that challenge. 
- When you Swear an Iron Vow, a progress track represents the challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your goal. 
- When you Undertake an Expedition, a progress track represents how favorable the journey has been.
- When you Make a Connection, a progress track represents the evolution of the relationship. 
- When you Enter the Fray, a progress track represents your advantage as you attempt to achieve your objective.

Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes that you fill in—or mark— as you advance toward your goal. When you initiate a challenge, these boxes are empty.

### Challenge Ranks
When you create a progress track, give the challenge a rank. In increasing order of severity, the ranks are troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, and epic.

Ranks help gauge the difficulty of a challenge. More importantly, they are a measure of its complexity. Higher ranked challenges will require more focus, more steps to complete, and more time—both in the imagined world and at the table. Troublesome is used for simple challenges. Dangerous is a typical challenge. Formidable is an intimidating challenge. Epic and extreme challenges require great effort and luck to overcome.

Important NPCs can be given a rank to help gauge their relative scale, power, and abilities. If you are undertaking a quest to defeat an NPC, facing an NPC in a fight, or establishing an NPC as a connection, their rank is considered along with the other aspects of the situation and goal.

When choosing a challenge rank, you should also consider how well your character is positioned. If circumstances give you an unusual advantage or disadvantage, nudge the rank up or down appropriately. For example, if you Enter the Fray weaponless and facing armed foes, you would raise the rank of your objective to reflect that disparity. If you secure the aid of a local scout before you Undertake an Expedition, you could lower the rank of the journey to represent their help.

### Marking Progress
Once you initiate a progress track, you make specific moves to advance toward that goal. These moves reward you with an opportunity to mark progress on the progress track for that challenge. For example, as you achieve victories on your path to fulfilling a vow, you Reach a Milestone and mark progress.

#consider *Link to Reach a Milestone*

Similarly, you mark progress on a journey when you Undertake an Expedition and reach a waypoint. For a connection, you mark progress as you Develop Your Relationship. In a fight, you make moves such as Strike or Gain Ground to mark progress against your objectives. These incremental moves let you amass advantages to have the best chance of success when you are ready to resolve the challenge.

Asset abilities may also offer an opportunity to mark progress on a challenge. For example, if you are a BRAWLER and Enter the Fray positioned in close quarters against your foe, you have the chance to immediately mark progress on an objective in that fight. 

#### How To Mark Progress
Each box in a progress track is filled with lines called ticks. A full box consists of four ticks in a star-shaped pattern. When a move or asset ability prompts you to mark progress, check the rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the illustration below. The boxes in a track are filled progressively from left to right.

STACKING PROGRESS If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

In addition, if a move or asset prompts you to “mark progress twice,” do so. For example, when you Strike and score a hit, you may mark progress twice against your objective for that fight. Any additional instances of “mark progress” gained through an asset ability stack on top of that reward

> [!quote] Narrative example
> You Undertake an Expedition across the wind-blasted terrain of the desert planet Sirocco. You have given the expedition a rank of dangerous, and are riding your HOVERBIKE support vehicle asset. You make the move for the first segment of the expedition, and roll a strong hit with a match. Per the Undertake an Expedition move, you mark progress on a strong hit. Your HOVERBIKE also has an ability that prompts you to mark progress when you score a strong hit with a match on an expedition. Between the move and the asset, that’s two instances of “mark progress” for this action. When you mark progress against a dangerous challenge, you normally mark 2 boxes. Since you can mark progress twice for this action, you mark 4 boxes total. Your trusty HOVERBIKE has sped you along on this expedition.

### Managing Progress Tracks
Your character sheet includes a progress track for your background vow, which is an epic vow you define when you create your character.

You can create and mark other progress tracks in your journal, on notepaper, or using the worksheets available within the Starforged Playkit. Some progress tracks—such as a combat track or low-ranked expedition track—might only be needed to resolve a scene or two. But most progress tracks will persist across sessions. For example, if you have a high-ranked connection you visit infrequently, their progress track may remain incomplete for the bulk of your campaign.

If you are playing Starforged with a digital tool, progress tracks are likely built into the interface. Or use whatever approach works for you to emulate boxes and ticks.

### Progress Moves
There are several key moves, called progress moves, which utilize progress tracks to resolve the outcome of challenges. For example, to see how you fare when you seize an objective in a fight, make the Take Decisive Action progress move.

#missingArt *Add diagram of move components?*
This label identifies a move as a progress move
A progress move uses a progress roll instead of an action roll. See the next page for how it works.

### Progress Rolls
You don’t make an action roll when making a progress move. Instead, tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four ticks). This is your progress score. Then, roll only the challenge dice and compare your progress score to the value of the dice. This is called a progress roll.

Important: It’s not necessary to fill your progress track before making your progress move. When deciding whether to make a progress move, you need to weigh the chance of success against the risk of continuing to make preparatory moves.

As with an action roll, if your progress score beats the challenge dice, it’s a strong hit. If you beat one of the challenge dice, it’s a weak hit. If you fail to beat either die, it’s a miss. The progress move will tell you how to resolve the challenge based on the outcome of your roll.

In the example below, compare your progress score of 5 to your challenge dice when making the progress move. The sixth progress box is only partially filled in, and doesn’t count toward the progress score.

#### Momentum and Progress Rolls
Momentum is ignored when you make a progress move. You cannot burn momentum on a progress roll, and you do not suffer negative momentum.

### Sharing Progress Tracks With Allies
When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a quest, expedition, connection, or fight—you share a progress track. This is called a shared challenge. When a move prompts someone to mark progress for that challenge, it is marked on your shared progress track.

When you make a progress move for a shared challenge, only one of you rolls the dice. The result will stand for the group.

If you are successful as you make a progress move to Fulfill Your Vow, Forge a Bond, or Finish an Expedition, anyone who was part of the shared challenge earns the legacy reward and marks the appropriate legacy track. See the next page for how that works.

## Legacy Tracks
Legacy tracks are a special type of progress track to show the evolution of your character. There are three legacy tracks on your character sheet: quests, bonds, and discoveries. When you begin play with a new character, these tracks are empty.

As you complete quests, form bonds, and make discoveries, you advance along these tracks by marking ticks and filling boxes. For each filled box, you gain experience to spend on new assets or asset upgrades.

Legacy tracks are also an abstract representation of your victories, the network of people you rely on, your understanding of the perils of the Forge, and the funds and resources you can bring to bear. As you advance along the tracks, envision how your character’s reputation grows.

### Marking Legacy Rewards
In recognition of notable achievements, moves and asset abilities will prompt you to mark ticks or fill boxes in one or more of your legacy tracks. This is called a legacy reward. For example, if you Make a Discovery, you earn two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

Legacy tracks are not given a rank, but are otherwise treated the same as a standard progress track. It takes four ticks to fill a box.

### Gaining Experience
When you fill a legacy track box, make the Earn Experience move for some well-earned rewards. Per that move, take 2 experience for each newly filled legacy box.

The two small experience counters attached to legacy track boxes each represent 1 earned experience. When you fill a legacy track box and Earn Experience, that experience is ready to spend.

### Spending Experience
You spend earned experience to gain or upgrade assets, including new modules for your ship, support vehicles, companions, paths, and deeds. These assets add new options for your character and bolster your actions in specific circumstances.

Per the Advance move, it costs 2 experience to upgrade an existing asset, and 3 experience to buy a new asset.

Once you spend experience, make a mark to fill in the experience counters. Each filled counter represents 1 spent experience.

==See page 54 to learn more about asset==.
#missingArt *Add Progress box marks?* 

> [!note]
> Fill the legacy track boxes completely from left to right. If you have a partially filled box and are given a legacy reward that prompts you to fill one or more boxes, convert the reward to ticks. For example, 2 boxes is 8 ticks. Then, fill the incomplete box first.

### Rolling Against a Legacy Track
If a move prompts you to make a test against a legacy track, treat it as a standard progress roll (page 43). Tally the number of filled boxes on the track for your progress score, roll your challenge dice, and compare the progress score to the challenge dice. As with a progress roll, momentum is ignored. 

### Clearing A Legacy Track
When you fill all ten boxes on a legacy track, you are not necessarily at the end of that path for your character. As noted in the Earn Experience move, if your life of adventure and peril continues after filling a legacy track, you may erase all filled boxes and experience counters, and resume marking legacy rewards in the now-empty track. When you clear the track, mark the “10” bubble in the top right corner. This is your reminder to treat the value of the track as 10 if you make a progress roll against it.

### Earning Experience On A Cleared Track
Because a cleared legacy track represents a character nearing the height of their potential, you gain experience at a slower rate on that track. Take 1 experience for each filled legacy track box instead of 2. 

### Continuing a Legacy
When your character’s time as Ironsworn is done—whether through retirement or more dire circumstances—you may pass on your legacy to a new character using the Continue a Legacy move. Through this move, you roll against each of the legacy tracks to see how your achievements and struggles echo through time.
