# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Assets
Assets are a key component of your character. They represent your background, skills, traits, companions, and resources. They have abilities that give you additional options and bonuses when making a move—or sometimes act as their own self-contained moves. When you create your character (page 100), you select your starting assets. As you fill boxes on your legacy tracks, you Earn Experience. This experience is spent to gain new assets or upgrade current assets. Starforged assets are formatted as printable or preprinted cards. Put them alongside your character sheet for easy reference.

#missingArt *Asset field description*
This is the asset name. In this rulebook, asset names are shown in ALL CAPS. 
This is the asset type.
Assets include a default ability, represented by the filled-in marker.
You spend experience, to acquire new abilities. When you purchase an upgrade, fill in the marker to show you now have that ability.

> [!note]
> Some assets abilities apply to a variety of moves. This is usually phrased as “when you make a move to [blank].” However, this flexibility does not include progress moves. Unless an asset specifically defines a benefit for a progress move, you cannot use an ability when making a progress roll.

## Asset Types
There are six types of assets: ==command vehicle, modules, support vehicles, paths, companions, and deeds.==

## Assets and the Fiction
Assets offer both mechanical and narrative advantages. For example, if you have the HEALER path, you benefit from that asset’s abilities as you make moves to treat others, diagnose illnesses, and study biological remains. It also provides justification to take actions other characters would not be capable of, such as advanced treatment techniques.

But even when you aren’t making moves, the HEALER path influences your character’s interests, manner, and opportunities. In a perilous galaxy where technology has limitations and resources are scarce, how does this valued expertise affect your relationships and the nature of your quests? How is it reflected in your personality and ambitions?

Some assets will be more influential than others in your character concept, but all of them contribute to how you envision your approaches and the situations you encounter.

## Acquiring and Upgrading Assets
When you create your character in the next chapter, you will take your STARSHIP and choose three other assets. Then, as you successfully overcome challenges and mark progress on your legacy tracks (page 44), you Earn Experience. This experience is spent to purchase or upgrade assets through the Advance move.

### Buying an Asset
Buying a new asset costs 3 experience. If you are playing with others, you should avoid picking the same asset as another player—this will help give each character their own capabilities and flavor.

### Upgrading an Asset
All assets include three abilities. The first will be filled in when you purchase the asset. Upgrading an asset to claim the second or third ability costs 2 experience each.

When you spend experience to upgrade an asset, fill in the dot on your asset card to show you’ve acquired the ability. The second and third abilities may be selected in any order.

### Building a Story Through Assets
You can Advance to spend experience when it is earned, or save it for future use. Either way, you should look to the fiction to give context and justification for your new abilities and resources. Let your selection of assets flow naturally from your character’s goals and the situations you encounter, or guide your story toward an asset you would like to purchase or upgrade.

Assets can even serve as the focus of a new vow, giving you a tangible objective or reward for undertaking a quest. Perhaps you gain a new SNUB FIGHTER by completing a quest in the service of a shipbuilder, or earn membership as a sanctioned TRADER in the merchant’s guild.

Envisioning how your new abilities connect to your sworn quests and experiences gives them additional significance and context. They will be a reminder of the paths taken and not taken, the challenges overcome, and the bonds formed
