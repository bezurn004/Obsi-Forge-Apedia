# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Oracles
In Starforged, an oracle is anything that generates random results to help determine the outcome of a move, the details of locations or characters, or a narrative event. In solo or co-op games, oracles help answer questions, flesh out your setting, and introduce drama and surprises. In guided play, the guide can use oracles for their own inspiration and answers. Starforged includes various oracle tables to generate random results. Some moves include their own tables. There are also a large variety of random tables starting in Chapter 5 (page 288) that can help provide inspiration for story events, reveal locations, generate characters and creatures, and guide the actions of others in your world. 

## Rolling Oracle Dice
Whenever you are prompted to generate a result between 1 and 100, roll two ten-sided dice. This is an oracle roll.

Using physical dice, there are two common methods for generating a 1–100 result. You can roll a set of D10s that includes tens digits on the faces of one of those dice.

#missingArt *Two d100 (oracle dice) -> Oracle result*

Or you can use two D10s of different colors, and decide before rolling which represents the tens digit and which is the units. 

#missingArt *Two D10 (oracle dice) -> Oracle result*

Either way, you might want to use a unique set of dice for oracle rolls, shared by everyone at the table. These dice will divine your fate and reveal the mysteries of the galaxy, so it’s worth giving them special treatment.

## Oracle Tables In Moves
Some moves may prompt you to roll on an oracle table, generating a result between 1 and 100, to help resolve the outcome of that move. For example, the Endure Stress table reveals your fate when you fail to resist a mental hardship. Will you carry on or will this crisis get the best of you?

If a move tells you to “roll or choose” on an oracle table, you decide whether you pick the most interesting or appropriate result, or roll to see what happens. Otherwise, you have no choice; you must cast your fate to the stars and roll the oracle dice.

## Asking the Oracle
If you are playing solo or co-op, you can make the Ask the Oracle move (shown below) to help guide your campaign and trigger ideas when you need to know what happens next. Its most basic function is to answer a “yes” or “no” question. Combined with your own instincts and creativity, this move—and other random prompts—can push your story in surprising and exciting directions.

Unlike other tables, a match is meaningful when rolling on the Ask the Oracle yes/no table. If you roll a match, envision the answer as an especially decisive yes or no, or give it a dramatic or interesting twist. 

> [!tip] Playing with a Guide
> If you are playing with a guide, they are the oracle. When you have a question or see a prompt to Ask the Oracle, that’s your cue to look to your guide for the answer. The guide can decide the answer, or use random tools and creative prompts for inspiration. They can even turn the question back to you, or ask you to roll on an oracle table. But keep in mind that, even when playing with a guide, Starforged is about shared storytelling. Offer suggestions. Talk it out. The guide is the final arbiter of what happens next, but everyone at the table should participate in building the world and creating the narrative of your campaign.


## A Universe of Oracles
This rulebook includes an array of oracle tables ==in Chapter 5 (page 288)==. Use these oracles to answer questions about your setting, drive the narrative, and inspire dramatic events and revelations. Some oracles are for specific, mundane questions to streamline play (“What is the smuggler’s name?”). Others provide more abstract results that you interpret based on the current situation (“What do I encounter here?”). 

Perhaps most importantly, that section includes a variety of oracles to help you visualize locations as you explore the Forge, ranging from the nature of a star to the details of a planetside settlement. The Starforged universe is meant to be discovered as you play, revealing new dangers and wonders; these oracles are your guide on that journey.

### Other Random Generators
You can also use whatever oracles you prefer, including those drawn from another game, online generators, or visual tools such as tarot cards. Assembling your personalized toolkit of oracles will help customize the tone and setting of the game to your preferences.

### Create Your Own Oracles
Create your own oracle tables to better fit your preferences or highlight unique aspects of your campaign. For example, you can create a table for encounters within an unusual planetary environment, or a table of random names suited to a particular faction or culture.

## Trust Your Instincts
Random generators don’t replace your own imagination and intuition. If it’s interesting, dramatic, and pushes the story forward, make it happen. Too much reliance on random generators to answer questions about “what happens next” can kill the momentum of your game or make it feel disconnected and incoherent.

Keep it moving. Ask a question. If an answer leaps to mind, go with it. If you’re not sure, Ask the Oracle. Then, play.

> [!note]
> If you are playing as the guide, use oracles to forge a universe at the table. The character-driven quests help you and the other players build a story together without preparation. Anything that is not a protagonist, move, or asset has very little mechanical detail, and can be introduced on the fly. You can even offload decisions to the other players, asking them to roll on a specific oracle and interpret the result.
