# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Conflict Between Allies
Starforged mechanics and moves are not intended to provoke conflict among allies. Instead, the focus is on the drama and challenges of perilous quests in a mysterious galaxy. You and your allies will stand together against the forces that would see your vows unfulfilled. You are working toward shared, or at least complementary, goals.

That said, situations within the fiction may put you and an ally at odds. Your characters are not perfect. They may try to act rashly in a tense situation. They might stubbornly cling to a self-defeating approach or point of view. They might pursue their own vows at the cost of their relationships. Making non-optimal choices as your character, creating more trouble for yourself, is part of dramatic storytelling. 

So how do you deal with the situation when allies clash?

## Conflict Without Moves
Disagreements between characters can usually be handled through roleplaying. Talk it out, as your characters. But take care to not let this fictional conflict carry over into the real world. If things get heated or uncomfortable, Take a Break. When you return to the game, discuss your approaches out-of-character, agree on next steps, and transition back into the fiction to resolve the situation from the perspective of your characters.

## Conflict Using Moves
If you want to resolve a conflict among allies through moves, make opposed [[Face Danger]] rolls to decide the outcome in a single exchange. 
- Both describe what you are doing to persuade, act against, or resist your ally, and [[Face Danger]] using an appropriate stat. 
- If at least one of you scores a hit, determine who gains control of the outcome by comparing your level of success in the order below:
	- strong hit with a match
	- strong hit
	- weak hit 
	- miss
	- miss with a match. 
	- If you both have the same level of success, use your action score (your action die + stat + any adds) as a tie-breaker.
	- If you are still tied, envision how your actions lead to a complete stalemate. 
- Whoever gains control of the outcome decides which of the two moves should be resolved and works with the other player to depict that result in the fiction. The result of the other move is ignored. 
- If neither of you scored a hit, resolve the miss for both moves. Each of you must [[Pay the Price]]. Use this procedure sparingly for unusual circumstances, taking care to not take control of another player’s character. Work together to interpret the framing and outcome of the scene, with each of you describing your character’s intent and reaction.

> [!quote] Narrative example
> Archer and Luna, stranded on the surface of a fungus-encrusted world, travel to a planetside industrial facility. They are in desperate need of help, but this remote outpost bears the markings of Clan Thorn, a powerful faction that is hunting for them both. Archer wants to give the facility a wide berth, but Luna is insistent on taking a closer look.
> 
> “Come on, let’s see what we can find,” Luna says. “We need to get off this toxic rock. They’ve probably got a spare shuttle lying about.” 
> 
> “That’s your plan?” Archer says. “We’ve been dodging Clan Thorn for weeks and you want to go say hello?”
> 
> “We don’t have any other options. You think there’s another settlement just around the next mushroom?”
> 
> Archer is not convinced. “No way. It’s too risky.” 
> 
> “We seem to be at an impasse,” Luna says. “Roll for it? I’ll Face Danger with iron to see if I can get your blood up.” 
> 
> “Sure. I’ll Face Danger plus heart to reason with you.”
> 
> Archer rolls a weak hit and Luna scores a strong hit. Since Luna achieves a higher degree of success on her move, she gets to decide the outcome. She chooses to let her move stand. She is successful and takes +1 momentum.
> 
> “I stand tall, look you straight in the eyes, and tell you that this is our only option,” Luna says. “Besides, isn’t it about time we get a bit of payback? Show Clan Thorn that we’re done running? I don’t know about you, but I’m in the mood to give this hornet’s nest a good kick.”
> 
> “Okay, fine, but I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” Archer says.
> 
> Luna laughs, “You always do.”
