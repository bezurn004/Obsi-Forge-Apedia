# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Momentum
Momentum is a special mechanic that is central to playing Starforged. Your momentum value ranges from a -6 to +10 and represents your inertia, luck, and confidence. Move results and asset abilities may prompt you to increase or decrease momentum.

Mechanically, high momentum gives you a chance to overcome the whims of fate and improve your result on an action roll. In the fiction, momentum helps portray whether your character is surging forward, or if the tide has turned against you.

The momentum meter is on the left side of your character sheet. You can use a paper clip or token to mark the current value. 

## Gaining Momentum
You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. If a move tells you to add momentum, phrased as “take +X momentum”, increase your momentum meter by that amount. The choices you make in a move, or the assets you use to support the move, may modify the value of the momentum gain.

In general, taking +1 momentum represents a minor advantage. Taking +2 momentum (or more) represents a major advantage. 

## Losing Momentum
When you suffer a cost that causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage, make the Lose Momentum move. Using this move, as appropriate to the severity of the situation, reduce your momentum by -1, -2, or -3.

Some moves or assets will prompt you to [[MV_Lose Momentum|Lose Momentum]] as part of an outcome for an action, and may specify an amount of momentum to suffer, phrased as “Lose Momentum (-X).” You might also choose to [[MV_Lose Momentum|Lose Momentum]] as a cost when you [[MV_Pay the Price|Pay the Price]].

## Burning Momentum
Burning momentum is a powerful option to build on your success and deliver a decisive result or avoid dire failure. When you have positive momentum, after you make an action roll, you may replace your action score with your current momentum value to improve your result.

For example, your momentum meter is at +7 and your action score is 4. You roll a 5 and an 9 on your challenge dice. This would normally be a miss, but you can burn momentum to make your action score 7 instead of 4. This shifts your result from a miss to a weak hit.

When you burn momentum, replace the action score with your momentum value. 

#missingArt  Action Die = Momentum ?> Challenge Dice

Burning momentum is never required. Even if you score a miss on a move and have enough momentum to beat the challenge dice, you can choose to suffer the failure and save your momentum for a more crucial moment.

After you burn momentum, you must reset your momentum.

## Resetting Momentum
After you burn momentum, you must immediately adjust your momentum meter to your momentum reset value.

The default reset is +2. This value is reduced when you suffer from an [[GP_Impacts|Impacts]]. Impacts are statuses such as wounded or traumatized. Certain moves will prompt you to mark an impact on your character sheet. 
- If you have one impact marked, your momentum reset is +1. 
- If you have more than one impact marked, your momentum reset is 0.

There is a box below the momentum meter to record your current momentum reset. This may rise and fall through the course of a single session, but some impacts are lasting and will permanently alter your reset value.

After you reset your momentum, resolve the move. If the move or an asset provides a momentum bonus as a reward for the move outcome (phrased as “take +X momentum”), adjust the meter appropriately.

> You [[MV_Face Danger|Face Danger]] to hack a locked door, score a miss, and burn momentum to improve the result to a strong hit. Your momentum reset is +2, so you adjust your momentum meter to that value. Then, you resolve the outcome of the move. Since a strong hit on [[MV_Face Danger|Face Danger]] prompts you to “take +1 momentum”, you raise your momentum meter from +2 to +3.

## Max Momentum
Your max momentum starts at +10. This maximum is reduced by 1 for each marked impact. For example, one impact will drop your max momentum to +9. Three impacts will reduce it to +7.

There’s a spot on your character sheet below the momentum meter to record your current max momentum value.

You can’t increase momentum over your max. If you are at your max and a move or asset gives you an option to increase your momentum, you can’t take advantage of that benefit.

## Suffering Negative Momentum
When your momentum is negative (less than 0), and it matches the number rolled on your action die, you must suffer negative momentum. Your action die is canceled for the purposes of tallying your action score. You still check the success of your move by comparing your stat plus any adds to the challenge dice, but you won’t have your action die to help you.

For example, your momentum is -4, and you roll a 4 on your action die. The action die is canceled and not included in the tally for the action score, leaving only the stat and adds.

#missingArt *Add dice?*
Momentum <0> Action Die + Stat + Add = Score

To make matters worse, if your action die is canceled, you can’t take a bonus from an asset ability triggered by that die.For example, if an ability is enabled by a prompt such as “If you roll a 6 on your action die,” you won’t gain that benefit of the canceled die. But if an asset forces a penalty for a specific action die value, such as stopping an ongoing power when you roll a 1, that outcome stands. In other words, nothing good comes of suffering negative momentum.

You only suffer negative momentum when the number on the action die matches the negative momentum value. Otherwise, it has no effect.

## Minimum Momentum
Your momentum cannot drop lower than -6. If you must [[MV_Lose Momentum|Lose Momentum]], and your momentum is already at its minimum, the [[MV_Lose Momentum|Lose Momentum]] will prompt you to apply the cost in some other way. This might include reducing a condition meter (such as health, spirit, or supply), or suffering a setback in a quest or other challenge.

## Tracking Momentum Between Sessions
Momentum is not reset between sessions. When you are finished playing, record your current momentum value. When you return to Starforged, begin play again with your momentum meter set to that value.

This also applies to the other meters on your character sheet, such as your [[GP_Condition Meters|Condition Meters]]. You are putting your story on pause, and will return to your character in the same state you left them, for better or worse.
