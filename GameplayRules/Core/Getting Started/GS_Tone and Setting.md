# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Tone and Setting

## Tone and Inspiration
Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with equipment often cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost. It’s a dangerous life for anyone living on this frontier, and doubly so for the Ironsworn, those adventurers bound to sworn quests.

Inspiration comes from the quest-driven stories of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and fantasy-infused trappings of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated horror of Alien, the mysticism and faction politics of Dune, the retro-tech and desperation of Battlestar Galactica’s modern reboot, the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse, and the gonzo adventures and fantastic locations of Guardians of the Galaxy.

You can bend the tone to your liking. You’ll make a unique version of the setting as you define aspects such as its history, technology, communities, lifeforms, supernatural abilities, and more

## The Setting
Your adventures are set within the Forge. This is a globular cluster in orbit around your people’s home galaxy. It is 1,700 light years above the galactic plane, a bright island in a dark void.

Interstellar nebula span the depths of the Forge, interspersed with denser clouds of vibrant interplanetary dust and strange energies. It is a chaotic galaxy wracked by fiery stellar storms and unpredictable gravitational currents. The planets and stars of this place are born of that chaos.

Your people came to the Forge two centuries ago in the wake of a cataclysm in their home galaxy. Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.

### Regions of the Forge
Your people divide the Forge broadly into four regions: 
- Terminus: Your people landed in this region following their exodus from their home galaxy. Settlements are common here. Factions compete for resources, and spaceborne caravans follow charted paths among the stars. But the Forge is a vast galaxy; even here, there are still unknown and isolated domains. 
- Outlands: In the last few decades, your people have pushed deeper into the galaxy, searching for habitable planets, resources, and opportunities. Settlements within the Outlands are scattered, and navigation paths are often uncharted. 
- Expanse: A few bold pioneers have delved the far-flung reaches of the Forge. Isolated settlements have been built among these distant domains, but they are usually lost and disconnected from the settled regions. 
- Void: Beyond the Forge, there are only a few isolated stars and vast gulfs of nothing. Travel beyond the periphery of the Forge is difficult or impossible.
