# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: The Basics
In Ironsworn: Starforged (hereafter referred to as Starforged), you are a spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. You will explore uncharted space, unravel the secrets of a mysterious galaxy, and build bonds with those you meet on your travels. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

To play Starforged, you make some decisions about the setting and your character, and set your story in motion. When you encounter something dangerous or uncertain, your choices and the dice determine the outcome. 

## Building On the Ironsworn Legacy
Starforged is a standalone sequel to the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game. If you’re an experienced Ironsworn player, welcome back! You’ll find some changes and enhancements to suit the spaceborne setting, but the core of the game will be familiar. If you’re new to Ironsworn, this rulebook will give you everything you need to undertake quests in a perilous galaxy. 

## Modes of Play
Starforged offers three ways to play: 
- Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, the protagonists in your story, while another player is the guide. The guide is sometimes referred to as a gamemaster or GM in other roleplaying games. Instead of playing as one of the protagonists, the guide helps bring the world to life, portrays the people and creatures the protagonists encounter, and works with the other players to decide the outcome of actions and events. 
- Cooperative (Co-op): You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required. The Starforged game system will help reveal the nature of locations, characters, and situations you encounter. 
- Solo: As with cooperative play, no guide is necessary. You portray a lone heroic character, using the Starforged game system to explore the dramatic story of your character and their fateful vows

> [!note]
> Starforged is intended for solo and small group play. One to three players (plus a guide if playing in that mode) is ideal. This rulebook is often written to the perspective of a solo player, but the basic approaches and rules are the same for co-op and guided play.
