# [[_Gameplay Guidelines Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Principles of Play
These principles are your polestars for managing Starforged sessions. Start here, and find your path to awesome stories.  There are four sections for this article that align to each role a player of Starforged.
- **[[#Universal Principles]]**
- **[[#Principles For Solo Play]]**
- **[[#Principles For Cooperative Play]]**
- **[[#Principles for the Guide]]**

## Universal Principles
Whether playing solo, cooperative, or with a guide, use the Starforged [[_Session Moves|Session Moves]] to help foster gameplay that is safe, supportive, and fun.

### Swear Iron Vows, and See Them Fulfilled or Forsaken
Sworn vows are the foundation of your Starforged stories. You introduce an urgent problem or personal quest, Swear an Iron Vow to set things right, and play to see what happens. The ritualized aspect of swearing vows gives your quests narrative weight in the fiction of your setting, while the mechanical framework provides inertia and structure for your gameplay sessions. 

### Portray a Perilous But Hopeful Future
The Forge is a dangerous and mysterious place, full of threats known and unknown. Too often, the people of the galaxy fight and scheme amongst themselves instead of standing together against these greater perils.

Likewise, your character is competent, perhaps even heroic, but not perfect. You are flesh and blood. You will fail. You will get hurt. You will make mistakes. You will lose faith. You will act against your better instincts. Make decisions through the flawed but driven perspective of this person.

Despite those sometimes grim realities, there is hope. There is beauty and wonder to be found. Love and kinship to be preserved. Wrongs to put right. Look for opportunities to reveal the optimistic and inspiring aspects of your story and setting.

### Begin and End with the Fiction
Set every scene and action within the fiction. What is happening? What are you doing? What does it look like? If a move is triggered, make it. Then, look to the fiction as you resolve the move and decide what happens next. Keep things moving forward, bookending the mechanics of your moves with the fiction.

Starforged rules, moves, and assets often use the term “envision.” This prompt is your reminder to visualize the scene or the action. Don’t rush through your moves with a focus on the mechanical outcomes. Let your story breathe. Go beyond the surface details. Ask questions (or [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]], and build on the answers. In co-op and guided modes, collaborate to create a shared understanding of the current situation. If something is unclear or at odds with the assumptions of another player, talk it out until everyone has a clear picture of the situation. When playing solo, take the time to imagine the scene and take note of important details.

## Principles For Solo Play

### Chronicle Your Adventures

When you play Starforged with other players, the shared conversation helps create a story that lives beyond the game table. When playing solo, the conversation is between you and the system. The mechanics and moves are part of that conversation, but your character and your world exist only for you.

This can make your story feel a bit fleeting. To ground your sessions and make it easier to pick up where you left off, keep a record at whatever level of detail you prefer. This can be simple bullet points in a text file, a log in a virtual tabletop, a handwritten journal filled with sketches and notes, a play report you share on a forum or blog, or even a streamed or recorded session. There’s no wrong answer. Use whatever approach is an enjoyable aspect of your play. If it feels like work, simplify.

### Ask the Oracle, but Trust Your Insticts
Oracles are a valuable tool for solo play, but don’t let them replace your own storytelling instincts. Too many oracle rolls can make a session feel like an exercise in randomness. Trust your gut. If it’s dramatic, fits the fiction, and pushes your story forward, make it happen. When you want to gloss over something, do so. Use the oracles to fill in the gaps. Keep it moving.

### Be a Fan of Your Character (Stop Hitting Yourself)
Here’s something unexpected: Solo players are hard on their characters. While a guide will moderate the severity of outcomes to keep everyone motivated and having fun, solo players often default to severe results when they suffer a cost or complication, grinding their character down through mechanical and narrative penalties. What’s more, they’ll envision these setbacks as inherent failings of the character, instead of factors out of their control.

Perhaps this is born out of a desire not to “cheat.” But you are the ultimate arbiter of your story; it’s not possible to cheat. In fact, the [[MV_Change Your Fate|Change Your Fate (move)]] offers explicit permission to alter, redo, or ignore any fictional or mechanical outcome that is unsafe or un-fun.

The gameplay of Starforged is tuned to introduce complications and adversity, so don’t be reluctant to give your character a break. Use the techniques described in the [[MV_Pay the Price|Pay the Price (move)]] summary to balance narrative and mechanical costs. Create a sense of rising tension by escalating the danger and risk of situation, instead of hitting your character hard out of the gate. Save the dire complications and major mechanical costs for key, dramatic moments. When it matters, make it hurt. Until then, give your character space to be awesome. They’ll thank you for it

## Principles For Cooperative Play

### Craft a Story Through Conversation
Roleplaying as a group is conversation. Use this conversation to build a shared imagining of your world. The deeper the conversation, the more opportunities you find to take your story in interesting new directions.

Ask questions of each other to help create a coherent, shared picture of what is happening in the fiction. Deepen your setting and your characters by adding evocative details. You’ll be surprised how often an offhand suggestion can snowball into exciting story possibilities.

### Build a Universe Together
When playing without a guide, you each take part in filling that role, crafting elements of the setting, portraying other characters, introducing challenges, posing questions, and providing answers. The nature of Starforged mechanics and oracles means you can do this in the moment, without preparation, switching from the perspective of your character and back again. When something is uncertain or you want to leave it to the whims of fate, [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]] and work together to interpret the answer.

### Share the Spotlight
Be a generous, collaborative player. Within scenes, work to keep each character visible and each player engaged. Use the conversation to give everyone input into the narrative. Share opportunities to roll on oracle tables and interpret the results.

For your broader campaign, don’t let one character’s vow drive your story through every session. Mix it up. Give each character opportunities to explore their own motivations and quests, and find ways to give everyone a personal stake in your sworn vows.

## Principles for the Guide

### Facilitate, Don't Impose
You are the guide for your players as they explore the setting and the story of their characters. You set the scenes and portray the creatures and characters they encounter. When the narrative hits a lull, or someone creates an opportunity for a complication, consequence, or discovery, make something happen.

But you are a guide with an unreliable compass heading into unknown realms. Let the players choose their path. Moderate the conversation without dominating it.

### Deliver Answers and Ask Questions
The players will look to you to answer questions about the setting, portray the actions and reactions of other characters, and help determine the outcome of moves. When they do, answer their question, keeping in mind the fiction and truths you’ve established through play.

You should also look for opportunities to motivate input from others at the table. Encourage them to add details and ground every move in the fiction. Work to create a shared world and narrative that everyone has stake in. Answer questions by asking questions. If a conversation hits a dead end or drags on, take the question back, deliver an answer (or [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]]), and move on.

### Embrace Chaos
Don’t over-prepare for your session. Feel free to come to the table with nothing planned. The character-driven quests help you and the other players build a story together. Anything that is not a protagonist or move has very little mechanical detail, and can be introduced on the fly.

Letting go of your plans leaves you open to the unexpected. Cheer for surprising successes. Seize the story possibilities of dramatic failures. Forge a galaxy of wonder and danger.

You can also use the oracles for answers and inspiration. Ask a yes/no question through the [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]], or interpret a response from the oracle tables. You can even collaborate with your players to interpret an oracle’s answer.
