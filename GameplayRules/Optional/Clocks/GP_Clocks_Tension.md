# [[_GP_Clocks|Clocks (gameplay)]]: Tension Clocks

## Tension Clocks
Use a tension clock to represent a looming threat or deadline in a scene, or an escalating danger that persists across scenes. Unlike campaign clocks, tension clocks do not advance independent of your actions. They are smaller-scope clocks that fill as you suffer setbacks or fail to act. Tension clocks are also best structed to be resolved within a single scene using a [[_Scene Moves|Scene Challenge]].

Here are a few examples of tension clocks in action: 
* You are retreating from a fight, but the enemy has called in reinforcements. You create a tension clock that fills as you are pinned down or delayed. When the clock is full, reinforcements arrive and block your way out.
* You are infected with a parasite that feeds on your adrenaline. You create a tension clock that fills as you face stressful situations. When the clock is full, the parasite reaches the next stage of its life cycle.
* You are escorting a cargo ship through enemy space. You create a tension clock to represent progressive damage to that ship. The clock advances as you 
* You are in a battle near an unstable reactor. You create a tension clock that fills as the reactor takes hits from errant gunfire. When the clock is full, an explosion is imminent.

### Setting a Tension Clock
To create a tension clock, name it and decide the number of segments. If the danger or deadline is imminent, make it four or six segments. If it represents a longer-term threat, make it eight or ten segments. 

### Advancing a Tension Clock
As you [[MV_Pay the Price]] or encounter a complication in a situation where a tension clock is active, you can resolve the cost or concession by filling a segment on the clock. The looming threat or deadline is getting closer. If it is a dramatic failure, such as a miss with a match, make it two segments.

### Completing a Tension Clock
Once the clock is filled, the threat or deadline triggers. This should result in harrowing problems for your character. It may even force you to abandon an expedition, fight, vow, or other challenge. 

### Stopping a Tension Clock
If you escape the looming threat or deadline, or it is no longer relevant, stop the clock and remove it from play.
