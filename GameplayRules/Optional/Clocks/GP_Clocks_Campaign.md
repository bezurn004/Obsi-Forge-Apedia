# [[_GP_Clocks|Clocks (gameplay)]]: Campaign Clocks
The Forge does not stand still. As you undertake your sworn vows and delve the depths of the galaxy, other people, factions, and threats evolve and advance their own agendas.

To depict and resolve the objectives and actions of these entities in the background of your campaign, use campaign clocks. 

Campaign clocks represent aspects of the setting that can be positive, negative, or neutral from your character’s perspective. Your character might be unaware of the factors powering a clock as it ticks away behind the scenes, or it can represent a looming danger or opportunity. 

Here are some examples of situations and projects using campaign clocks: 
* An unstable star builds toward a supernova. When the clock is full, nearby planets and settlements face cataclysmic destruction. 
* A powerful faction is building a new waystation on the frontier of settled space. When the clock is full, the outpost is open for business. 
* A far-reaching computer virus infects computers throughout a sector. When the clock is full, the virus compromises a key data hub. 
* A mercenary company conducts a violent offensive to seize a key mining facility. When the clock is full, they take control. 
* Researchers work to develop a technology for matter teleportation. When the clock is full, this new tech is deployed. 
* A band of scrappy rebels fight to overthrow a tyrannical faction. When the clock is full, that faction is destroyed or driven out of the sector. 
* A cult gathers artifacts that will usher in a return of ancient and malevolent beings. When the clock is full, the portal is opened. 

## Setting a Campaign Clock
Give the clock a name that makes it clear what project is complete or event triggered when the clock is filled. Then, decide the number of segments as appropriate to the complexity and duration of the activities leading to that ultimate outcome.

It’s not an exact science, but you can equate segments of a clock to the number of gameplay sessions or chapters before it triggers, plus or minus two. For example, a clock with six segments will probably trigger in four to eight sessions—unless something stops it.

> [!quote] Narrative example
> Northstar Syndicate, a ruthless trade guild, is waging a campaign to take control of facilities, exchanges, and charted passages in a key sector. Through bribes, threats, and force, they’ll attempt to squeeze out or eliminate other trade operations. You create a campaign clock with six segments to track their progress.

## Advancing a Campaign Clock

When you [[Begin a Session]], make a check against any active campaign clocks. If advancing a clock is not in doubt—enough time has passed or the pieces are in place to make it inevitable—simply fill in the next segment. If circumstances or time conspire to push the clock forward more rapidly, fill two segments.

If there are factors or forces that create uncertainty, you can [[Ask the Oracle]] using the yes/no table.

To make the check, [[Ask the Oracle]], “does the clock advance?” Set the outcome to likely as your default, and adjust up or down one row if other factors or forces (including your own aid or interference) have a strong influence on the clock. If it is more likely, make it almost certain. If it is less likely, make it 50/50. In exceptional circumstances, you can push the chance as low as unlikely.

**If the answer is yes**, fill a clock segment. If you also roll a match on your oracle dice, envision how this situation or project gains dramatic support or inertia, and fill two segments instead of one.

**If the answer is no**, do not fill a segment. The situation or project has stalled for now, or encountered resistance. If you also roll a match on your oracle dice, envision a surprising turn of events that pits new factors or forces against the clock.

You can also make checks for your campaign clocks in the midst of a session when significant time passes, or when circumstances in your narrative push a clock forward.

## Completing a Campaign Clock
Once the clock is filled, the event is triggered or the project is complete. Envision the outcome and the impact on your setting. If your character becomes aware of a crisis or opportunity triggered by the clock, it might be the catalyst for a new quest.

### Rival Campaign Clocks
If two powers or factions are pursuing opposing goals, give each a clock to track both sides of the conflict. When you Ask the Oracle if those clocks advance, consider their relative strength and approaches as you set the likelihood for each. Then, envision the actions and outcome as appropriate to whether both, neither, or only one of the clocks advance. When one of the rival clocks is completely filled, that power or faction achieves its goal, and the other fails or is defeated. Both clocks are then removed from play.

> [!tip] Guides and Clocks
> Guides can use campaign clocks to manage off-screen events and faction activities. Some clocks can be made visible to the players, while others are used to advance situations they don’t have knowledge of (yet).
