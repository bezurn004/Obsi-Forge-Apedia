# [[_Campaign Index|Campaign Creation]]: Prioritizing Player Safety
==Safety tools== enable players to check in with one another before, during, and after a roleplaying session to ensure everyone feels safe and supported, especially when things in-game get tense, dark, or frightening. These tools focus on consent, collaboration, and prioritizing people at the table over the narrative. While many safety tools exist and are freely available, _Starforged_ includes safety tools as part of the ==[[_Session Moves|session moves]]==.

The point of these session moves and other safety tools is not to suppress or sanitize your ideas, but rather to facilitate consent and comfort to the subject matter, events, and actions of the game at all times. Because you define your setting assumptions using the exercises in this chapter, you are aware of some of the themes and events likely to emerge in play; but you can’t predict exactly what might happen during the course of your game. 

## Trauma In The Forge
The Forge is a place full of danger and mystery, and your character may encounter situations that put them in harm’s way or leave them with lingering trauma. It is very important to remember that while your character may get hurt, stressed, or traumatized within the fiction of the game, it should still be at a level you find it enjoyable or comfortable as a player. There are many ways to lean into the dangers of the Forge without trespassing on personal boundaries or compromising your own safety and comfort. 

## Safety Tools and Solo Play
Boundaries and consent are important when playing with others, since we cannot predict what someone else will do or say. But the importance of safety tools while playing solo may not be entirely obvious.

In some ways, safety tools become even more vital in solo play; playing alone means you’re responsible for your own check-ins. You have the freedom to explore content you may not be comfortable exploring in group settings, but also run the risk of making the game uncomfortable or un-fun without becoming aware of it until it is too late. The session moves encourage you to pause, reflect, and decide if, when, and how you want to move forward.

## Setting Content Flags
Take a moment to review the session moves with everyone at the table. You’ll find a printable moves reference as part of the _Starforged Playkit_, available for download at ironswornrpg.com.

As you work through the campaign launch exercises and anytime during play, use the [[MV_Set a Flag|Set a Flag (move)]] to identify content boundaries. This can include content that will be omitted, modified, or addressed on a case-by-case basis if it is encountered in your game.

![[MV_Set a Flag#Set A Flag Move Card]]

Work together with other players to ensure a collaborative environment where everyone can [[MV_Set a Flag|Set a Flag (move)]]. But keep in mind that using this move should not force a discussion of a content boundary. Players do not need to provide details or justification. If that is their wish, note the flagged content and move on. 

## Using Other Safety Tools
You might find that the _Starforged_ session moves don’t fit the needs of your table. Each person is unique in what safety tools work for them, and many other safety tools address this variety of needs. You can explore resources like the TTRPG Safety Toolkit to find safety tools that work best for you and your game. The TTRPG Safety Toolkit, curated by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk, is a compilation of safety tools designed by members of the tabletop roleplaying game community. You can find it here: bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit.
