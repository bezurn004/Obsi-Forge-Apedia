# [[_CRG_Create Your Character|Create Your Character]]: Background Vow
Next, you’ll envision and mark down a ==background vow== to represent a primary motivation or ultimate goal.

## Envision The Vow
Consider what you know of the setting and your character thus far. What nagging ambition, aching need, or sacred commitment drives you? This is your background vow.

This vow is part of your character’s history, sworn months ago or years ago. It can be tied to your backstory, or represent a deeper lifelong goal.

Fulfilling this vow will not be easy. Mechanically, it’s an epic vow, so every opportunity to [[MV_Reach a Milestone|Reach a Milestone (move)]] is just one tick on the vow’s progress track. In story-time, it might require months, years, or even decades to see this vow fulfilled or forsaken. You may even decide your background vow isn’t something you make significant progress on in your narrative; instead, it helps establish some roleplaying detail for your character and fleshes out your setting.

> [!tip] **Background Vows and Allies**
If you are playing _Starforged_ with others, you should each have your own background vow. This is part of what makes your character unique.

## Write The Vow
Mark the vow on your character sheet in the spot labeled “Background Vow.” Write the name of the vow using the imagined words of your character, such as:
- I vow to destroy the Iron Talon raider clan.
- I will discover a means of preserving consciousness beyond death.

> Normally, you make the Swear an Iron Vow move to see what happens as you begin a quest. But you’ve already sworn this vow as part of your background, and don’t need to actually make the move in-game.

## Can't Think Of A Vow?
If you’re having trouble coming up with a background vow, try rolling on some oracle tables for inspiration. [[OCL_Core_Action-Theme|Action and Theme]] or [[OCL_Character-Drives#Oracle Character Goal|Chracter Goal]] and interpret the result. You can also take a look back at the [[CRG_Quest Starters|Quest Starters]] for your selected truths in the previous exercise.

Or just leave the background vow blank for now and add it once something occurs to you during play.
