# [[_CRG_Create Your Character|Create Your Character]]: Create Your Backstory
As you begin play in Starforged, your character is a person with few ties to others. The Forge is a vast galaxy, and your former home, if you had one, is lost to you, forsaken by you, or a distant memory.

Consider what happened to sunder or separate you from your home and relationships. This is your backstory. This origin can influence the stories you explore and vows you undertake as you play Starforged, or it might just provide some texture to help bring your character to life.

Keep it simple. There’s no need to invent an elaborate history. You can discover more about your character through play.

> [!tip] **Building a Backstory With Other Players**
> If you are playing with others, discuss your mutual history. Have you known one another for years, do you have only casual links, or are you only now forming a team as the campaign begins? Your backstories should not prohibit you from working with each other. You are allies with shared or complementary goals. A bit of friendly rivalry or friction between characters can make for good storytelling, but in the end you will stand together against those forces that would see your vows unfulfilled.
