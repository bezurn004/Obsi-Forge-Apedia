# [[CRG_Create Your Backstory|Create Your Backstory]] : Truth Background Prompts

## Character Backstory Prompts From Truths
During the creation of the truths for the campaign, there are certain prompts to envision how your character relates to the galaxy you now call home.  Review these truths and provide detail for some of them to pair your to the setting.  Don't feel the need to provide an answer to all of these, as inspiration might come during play as new aspects of the truths are revealed or changed.

| [[TR_Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]] | Do you possess a keepsake or artifact of pre-cataclysm society? What is it? Why is it important to you? |
| [[TR_Exodus\|Exodus]] | Does your family or cultural history offer any stories of the Exodus? How does this legacy impact you today? |
| [[TR_Iron\|Iron]] | What do you swear vows upon? Why is this object meaningful to you? |
| [[TR_Magic\|Magic]] | If magic is an aspect of your setting, how does your character and their culture view these unnatural abilities? |
| [[TR_Medicine\|Medicine]] | Do you bear any notable scars or prosthetics? Do you have any medical or physical disabilities? These aspects might influence your look or approach. |
