# [[_Campaign Index|Campaign Creation]]: Sector Creation Summary
In this exercise, you prepare a starting sector. This area of space will serve as the backdrop as your adventures begin. If you prefer to skip this exercise, jump straight to a [[CSG_Pre-Generated Sector|Pre-Generated Sector]]. If you want to play in a more free-form galaxy, you can also handwave or ignore sectors entirely. Use this exercise if you want some additional stage-setting and a local connection for the start of your campaign. 

Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise. 

## What You Will Need
This exercise uses the sector worksheet and connections worksheet. Both are included in the the Starforged Playkit. If you are playing Starforged using a digital tool or prefer some other template, you just need space for notes and a simple map

## Steps to Build Your Sector
```dataview
TABLE without ID
	link(file.link, alias) As Title
WHERE contains(PageType, "Campaign") & contains(PageCategory, "Sector") & !contains(PageType, "Index") & !contains(PageCategory, "Index") & !contains(file.path, "Template")
SORT CategoryOrder Asc
```

## What Is a Sector?
A sector is a settled or explored area of space. In the fiction of your setting, sectors are named and provide the people of the Forge a common means of identifying a location or mapping the domains of a power or faction. For example, someone might say “Bleakhold Station is in the Devil’s Maw.” Your character would need more precise charts or coordinates to actually pinpoint that station in the Devil’s Maw sector, but it’s a start.

From a player’s perspective, sectors help you manage the details of your travels and interactions. A known sector can serve as a setting for your sworn quests. Then, as you head out into the unknown, you can discover, explore, and name new sectors.

## Managing This Exercise
This exercise will walk you through the process of creating a basic sector for the start of your campaign. If you are playing with others, one of you can read or summarize each step. Everyone should participate in making decisions, rolling on oracle tables, and embellishing narrative hooks. 

## Creating a Starting Sector As the Guide
If you are the guide, you should moderate this exercise with your players to give everyone a stake in the setting and starting situations. Keep things moving, and don’t get hung up on details. You’ll discover more about these locations and the people who live there through play.
