## Scattered and Few
**Few survived the journey to the Forge, and we are scattered to the winds in this perilous place.** ^truth-1-summary
 
Our settlements are often small, starved for resources, and on the brink of ruin. Hundreds of far-flung settlements are lost and isolated within the untamed chaos of this galaxy, and we do not know their fate. ^truth-1-body

> _Quest Starter_
> A settlement on an icebound planet is found abandoned. There is no sign of an attack. No bodies. Their ships and vehicles sit idle. The people are simply gone. Vanished. What is your connection to this place? ^queststarter-1

## Founder Clans
**Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans.** ^truth-2-summary
 
We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common. ^truth-2-body

> _Quest Starter_
> A forsaken people, sworn to no clan, live on an orbital station. A recent illness left many sick or dead. Supplies are urgently needed. Why were these people exiled, and why do you swear to give them aid? Which clan stands against you? ^queststarter-2

## Bountiful Balefires
**We have made our mark in this galaxy, but the energy storms we call balefires threaten to undo that progress, leaving our communities isolated and vulnerable.** ^truth-3-summary
 
Starships navigate along bustling trade routes between settlements. We’ve built burgeoning outposts on the fringes of known sectors, and bold spacers chart new paths into unexplored domains. But this hard-earned success is threatened by the chaotic balefires, intense energy anomalies that cut off trade routes and threaten entire planets. ^turth-3-body

> _Quest Starter_
> A balefire threatens a deep-space settlement. Can a rescue fleet be marshaled in time to transport the inhabitants of the station to safety? What foe stands in the way?
> ^queststarter-3
