#  [[_Truths Index|Truths]]: Artificial Intelligence
Choose or envision how artificial intelligence has evolved after the migration to the Forge...

## Roll Results

## The Adepts
**We no longer have access to advanced computer systems. Instead, we must rely on the seers we call Adepts.** 
 
Our computers are limited to simple digital systems and the most basic machine intelligence. This is because:

| 1d100 | Result |
|:---:|:--- |
| 1-33 | The energies of the Forge corrupt advanced systems |
| 34-67 | AI was outlawed in the aftermath of the machine wars |
| 68-100 | We have lost the knowledge to create and maintain AI |

The Adepts serve in place of those advanced systems. They utilize mind-altering drugs to see the universe as a dazzling lattice of data, identifying trends and predicting outcomes with uncanny accuracy. But to gain this insight they sacrifice much of themselves.

## Scarce Intelligence
**The vestiges of advanced machine intelligence are coveted and wielded by those in power.** 
 
Much of our AI technology was lost in the Exodus. What remains is under the control of powerful organizations and people, and is often wielded as a weapon or deterrent. The rest of us must make do with primitive systems.

## Mass Intelligence

**Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge.** 
 
Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge.

## Quest Starters

## ![[character.svg|20]] Character Prompts
- If you are accompanied by machine intelligence, you might have a companion such as a.. 
	- [[AST_Combat Bot|Combat Bot (asset)]]
	- [[AST_Protocol Bot|Protocol Bot (asset)]]
	- [[AST_Survey Bot|Survey Bot (asset)]]
	- [[AST_Utility Bot|Utility Bot (asset)]]
- If your ship has an AI, you might have the [[AST_Overseer|Overseer (asset)]] module. 

If AI in your campaign is rare or unavailable, these units will operate using very basic machine intelligence. 
If AI is common and advanced, they may have their own sentient personalities.
