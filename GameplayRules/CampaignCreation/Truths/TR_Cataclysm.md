## The Sun Plague
**The Sun Plague extinguished the stars in our home galaxy.**
  
The anomaly traveled at incredible speeds, many times faster than light itself, and snuffed out the stars around us before we realized it was coming. Few of us survived as we made our way to this new galaxy. Here in the Forge, the stars are still aflame. We cling to their warmth like weary travelers huddled around a fire.

We suspect the Sun Plague was caused by:

## Alien Invaders
**Interdimensional entities invaded our reality.** 
 
Without warning, these implacable and enigmatic beings ravaged our homeworlds. We could not stand against them. With the last of our defenses destroyed, our hope gone, we cast our fate to the Forge. Here, we can hide. Survive.

These entities took the form of:

| 59-72 | Beings of chaotic energy |
| 73-86 | Titanic creatures of horrific power |
| 87-100 | World-eating abominations of unimaginable scale |

## Unending War
**We escaped the ravages of a catastrophic war.** 
 
Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. In the end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent bid for power. Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start.

In this final war, we were set upon by:

| 1d100 | Result |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1-20 | Artificial intelligence |
| 21-40 | Religious zealots |
| 41-60 | Genetically engineered soldiers |
| 61-80 | Self-replicating nanomachines |
| 81-100 | A tyrannical faction or leader |
