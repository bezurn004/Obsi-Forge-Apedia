Choose or envision the weight of war as communities vie for dominance of the scarcities and wonderous discoveries the Forge offers...

## Scavenged Arms
**Here in the Forge, resources are too precious to support organized fighting forces or advanced weaponry.** 
 
Weapons are simple and cheap. Starships are often cobbled together from salvage. Most communities rely on ragtag bands of poorly equipped conscripts or volunteers to defend their holdings, and raiders prowl the Forge in search of easy prey.

## Guns For Hire
**Professional soldiers defend or expand the holdings of those who are able to pay. The rest of us are on our own.** 
 
Mercenary guilds wield power in the Forge. Some are scrappy outfits of no more than a dozen soldiers. Others are sector-spanning enterprises deploying legions of skilled fighting forces and fleets of powerful starships. Most hold no loyalty except to the highest bidder.

## Shock And War
**War never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops.** 
 
Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains, and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.
