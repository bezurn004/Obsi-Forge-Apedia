# [[_Campaign Index|Campaign Creation]]: Truths
## [[CTR_Choose Your Truths|Choose Your Truths]]
To begin creating the truths for your campaign start first with the above page.  This will provide the default assumptions about the forge and provide guidance and inspiration on this exercise to craft a compelling stage for your adventures in the Forge.

## Campaign Truths
View the truths listed below in the order present.  Remember, if none of the options suite how you envision the Forge you are free to write your own compelling summary on the topic.  These truths, while held by the majority of humanity, are not set in stone and should evolve over time as your story progresses.
