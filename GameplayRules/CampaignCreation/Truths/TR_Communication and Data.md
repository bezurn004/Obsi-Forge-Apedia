## Dark Data Age
**Much was lost when we came to the Forge. It is a dark age.** 
 
The knowledge that remains is a commodity as valuable as the rarest resource. Information is collected, hoarded, and jealously guarded. Ships and outposts endure prolonged periods of isolation, and rumors or disinformation are used to gain advantage or undermine foes.


## Data Couriers
**Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements.** 
 
Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.


## Data Weave
**In settled domains, a network of data hubs called the Weave allow near-instantaneous communication and data-sharing between ships and outposts.** 
 
Because of their importance, Weave hubs are often targets for sabotage, and communication blackouts are not uncommon. Beyond the most populous sectors, travelers and outposts are still commonly isolated and entirely off the grid.
