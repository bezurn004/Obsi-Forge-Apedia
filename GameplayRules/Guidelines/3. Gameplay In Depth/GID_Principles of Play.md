## Universal Principles
Whether playing solo, cooperative, or with a guide, use the _Starforged_ [[_Session Moves|Session Moves]] to help foster gameplay that is safe, supportive, and fun.

### Swear Iron Vows, and See Them Fulfilled or Forsaken
Sworn vows are the foundation of your _Starforged_ stories. You introduce an urgent problem or personal quest, [[MV_Swear an Iron Vow|Swear an Iron Vow]] to set things right, and play to see what happens. The ritualized aspect of swearing vows gives your quests narrative weight in the fiction of your setting, while the mechanical framework provides inertia and structure for your gameplay sessions. 

### Portray a Perilous But Hopeful Future
The Forge is a dangerous and mysterious place, full of threats known and unknown. Too often, the people of the galaxy fight and scheme amongst themselves instead of standing together against these greater perils.

Likewise, your character is competent, perhaps even heroic, but not perfect. You are flesh and blood. You will fail. You will get hurt. You will make mistakes. You will lose faith. You will act against your better instincts. Make decisions through the flawed but driven perspective of this person.

Despite those sometimes grim realities, there is hope. There is beauty and wonder to be found. Love and kinship to be preserved. Wrongs to put right. Look for opportunities to reveal the optimistic and inspiring aspects of your story and setting.

### Begin and End with the Fiction
Set every scene and action within the fiction. What is happening? What are you doing? What does it look like? If a move is triggered, make it. Then, look to the fiction as you resolve the move and decide what happens next. Keep things moving forward, bookending the mechanics of your moves with the fiction.

_Starforged_ rules, moves, and assets often use the term “envision.” This prompt is your reminder to visualize the scene or the action. Don’t rush through your moves with a focus on the mechanical outcomes. Let your story breathe. Go beyond the surface details. Ask questions (or [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]], and build on the answers. In co-op and guided modes, collaborate to create a shared understanding of the current situation. If something is unclear or at odds with the assumptions of another player, talk it out until everyone has a clear picture of the situation. When playing solo, take the time to imagine the scene and take note of important details.
