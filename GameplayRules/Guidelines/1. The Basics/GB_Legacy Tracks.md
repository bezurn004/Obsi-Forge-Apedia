# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Legacy Tracks
==Legacy tracks== are a special type of progress track to show the evolution of your character. There are three ==legacy tracks== on your character sheet: ==quests==, ==bonds==, and ==discoveries==. When you begin play with a new character, these tracks are empty.

> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#Quests]]
> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#Bonds]]
> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#Discoveries]]

As you complete quests, form bonds, and make discoveries, you advance along these tracks by marking ticks and filling boxes. For each filled box, you gain experience to spend on new assets or asset upgrades.

Legacy tracks are also an abstract representation of your victories, the network of people you rely on, your understanding of the perils of the Forge, and the funds and resources you can bring to bear. As you advance along the tracks, envision how your character’s reputation grows.

## Marking Legacy Rewards
> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#^legacy-track-diagram-4]]

In recognition of notable achievements, moves and asset abilities will prompt you to mark ticks or fill boxes in one or more of your legacy tracks. This is called a legacy reward. For example, if you [[MV_Make a Discovery|Make a Discovery (move)]], you earn two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

Legacy tracks are not given a rank, but are otherwise treated the same as a standard progress track. It takes four ==ticks== to fill a ==box==.

## Gaining Experience
> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#^legacy-track-diagram-5]]

When you fill a legacy track box, make the [[MV_Earn Experience|Earn Experience (move)]] for some well-earned rewards. Per that move, take 2 ==experience== for each newly filled legacy box.

The two small ==experience counters== attached to legacy track boxes each represent 1 earned experience. When you fill a legacy track box and [[MV_Earn Experience|Earn Experience (move)]], that experience is ready to spend.

## Spending Experience
> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#^legacy-track-diagram-6]]

You spend earned experience to gain or upgrade ==assets==, including new modules for your ship, support vehicles, companions, paths, and deeds. These assets add new options for your character and bolster your actions in specific circumstances.

Per the [[MV_Advance|Advance (move)]], it costs 2 experience to upgrade an existing asset, and 3 experience to buy a new asset.

Once you spend experience, make a mark to fill in the experience counters. Each filled counter represents 1 spent experience.

To learn more about [[GB_Assets|Assets (gameplay)]] in a later page.

> Fill the legacy track boxes completely from left to right. If you have a partially filled box and are given a legacy reward that prompts you to fill one or more boxes, convert the reward to ticks. For example, 2 boxes is 8 ticks. Then, fill the incomplete box first.

### Rolling Against a Legacy Track
If a move prompts you to make a test against a legacy track, treat it as a standard [[GB_Progress Tracks#Progress Rolls|progress roll]]. Tally the number of filled boxes on the track for your progress score, roll your challenge dice, and compare the progress score to the challenge dice. As with a progress roll, momentum is ignored. 

### Clearing A Legacy Track
When you fill all ten boxes on a legacy track, you are not necessarily at the end of that path for your character. As noted in the [[MV_Earn Experience|Earn Experience (move)]], if your life of adventure and peril continues after filling a legacy track, you may erase all filled boxes and experience counters, and resume marking legacy rewards in the now-empty track. When you clear the track, mark the “10” bubble in the top right corner. This is your reminder to treat the value of the track as 10 if you make a progress roll against it.

### Earning Experience On A Cleared Track
Because a cleared legacy track represents a character nearing the height of their potential, you gain experience at a slower rate on that track. Take 1 experience for each filled legacy track box instead of 2. 

### Continuing a Legacy
When your character’s time as Ironsworn is done—whether through retirement or more dire circumstances—you may pass on your legacy to a new character using the [[MV_Continue a Legacy|Continue a Legacy (move)]]. Through this move, you roll against each of the legacy tracks to see how your achievements and struggles echo through time.
