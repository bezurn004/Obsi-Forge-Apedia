# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]]: Vehicles
There are three types of vehicles you’ll rely on as your travel through the perilous depths of the Forge.

## Command Vehicle
Your ==command vehicle== is your [[AST_Starship|STARSHIP]], earned at character creation. It is an interstellar craft capable of faster-than-light travel. If you are playing with others, you and your allies share this asset. If you are playing in solo mode, you can fly the ship as a lone spacer thanks to automation and centralized controls. The command vehicle has an integrity meter, and can suffer from battered or cursed impacts.

_See below table for a rough approximation of the diagram from the rulebook_  shown on pages 66–67 for a cutaway illustration of a typical STARSHIP.

## Support Vehicles
==[[GB_Assets#Support Vehicles|Support vehicles]]== are assets that represent special secondary vehicles. They can be carried and launched by your [[AST_Starship|Starship (asset)]]. They have an integrity meter, and can suffer from the battered impact.

## Incidental Vehicles
An ==incidental vehicle== is one you temporarily acquire through the course of your story. For example, if you need to journey across the surface of an ocean world, you might borrow a sea-skimmer from a local settlement. Incidental vehicles have an integrity meter, but cannot be marked as battered. When you board an incidental vehicle, envision its nature and assign a max integrity as follows.

```

If you or an ally aren’t controlling a vehicle—you’re just along for the ride—it’s not an incidental vehicle and does not have an integrity meter.

> When you face off against vehicles (or vehicle-sized foes), consider their relative scale and capabilities as you assign ranks to progress tracks and resolve moves. In some cases, direct attacks are useless. A [[AST_Snub Fighter|SNUB FIGHTER]] can’t harm a moon-sized station unless there’s a weakness it can exploit. Because NPCs and their vehicles don’t have mechanical detail, always frame the nature of the encounter and your actions as appropriate to the established fiction of the scene.

> The Ornithor Class Starship, despite having gone out of production decades ago, is popular among independent spacers for its flexibility and durability. Most remaining Ornithors have been refitted and repurposed multiple times, so their configuration and internal spaces will vary. This example can accommodate a variety of roles, including cargo and passenger transport, exploration, and combat operations.
