# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]]: The Action Roll
The ==action roll== is the most common test you’ll make for your character. When you make a move triggered by a risky or uncertain action, roll these three dice at once to see what happens. 

> ==**Action Die**==
> One six-sided die (d6)
> #missingArt _d6 perspective blank faced_

> ==**Challenge Dice**==
> Two ten-sided dice (d10)
> #missingArt _Two 2d perspective blank faced_

After rolling, add a ==stat== to your action die. The move will tell you what stat to add (phrased as “roll +stat”), or may give you a choice. Some moves will tell you to use one of your ==condition meters==, such as health or supply, in place of a stat. You may also have an opportunity to apply one or more bonuses called ==adds== (phrased as “add +X”).

The total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is your action score. The action score is never greater than 10—anything over that is ignored.

To determine the outcome of your move, check if the action score beats the individual values of the challenge dice.

> ![[GSRY_Diagrams#^action-roll-diagram-2]]

There are three possible outcomes for the action roll. #missingArt
- ![[outcome-strong-hit.svg|40]] ==**Strong Hit**== Your action score beats the value of both challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do. 
- ![[outcome-weak-hit.svg|40]] ==**Weak Hit**== Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.
- ![[outcome-miss.svg|40]] ==**Miss**== Your action score doesn’t beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions

## Resolving the Outcome
Based on your result (strong hit, weak hit, or miss), the move will tell you how to interpret the outcome of your action. It might also offer you a choice. The result may include mechanical changes to your character’s status and narrative changes to the current situation.

Then, envision how the overall situation has changed. 
* **A strong hit means you are in control.** You are driving the narrative and taking proactive actions. What do you do next? 
* **A weak hit means the situation is slipping out of your control.** Instead of acting, you react. How do you respond? 
* **A miss means you have lost control of the situation.** You encounter hardships, new dangers, or increasing risk. What happens next?

Remember: Your action score needs to beat—not equal—the challenge dice to count as a hit. Ties go to the challenge dice. Since your action score can’t exceed 10, this means you never beat a 10 on a challenge die.

### Paying the Price
When you score a miss on a move, you’ll usually see a prompt to [[MV_Pay the Price|Pay the Price (move)]]. This is a special move that lets you pick a likely negative outcome, roll on a table to see what happens, or use some other random prompt.

If you are ==the guide==, you can consult with the [[MV_Pay the Price|Pay the Price (move)]] and tell the player the price as appropriate to the situation. Or just ask them to name their own price.

The main thing to remember when you must [[MV_Pay the Price|Pay the Price (move)]]: Something happens. The situation gets more complex, dramatic, or dangerous. This can mean a narrative consequence that complicates things for your character, or a combination of a narrative and mechanical cost. Depending on the situation, the negative outcome might be framed as a result of an error or misstep, or as an external event you had no control over.

Be mindful of pacing. Don’t drop the hammer on your character after one bad action roll. Start with lesser consequences appropriate to the situation, and apply escalating danger and hardships if the failures stack up.

> Some moves and asset abilities modify the standard action roll, such as permitting a reroll or replacing the action die with another value. The text of that move or ability will describe how it switches things up. If you have a question about a term or phrase, check the [[GSRY_Definitions|glossary]] 

## Rolling Matches
When you make an action roll, check the value of the challenge dice. If they are the same, you’ve rolled a match.

> ![[d10-8-t.svg|80]] ![[d10-8-t.svg|80]]

Some moves and assets offer specific outcomes for rolling a match. For example, if you [[MV_Explore a Waypoint|Explore a Waypoint (move)]] and roll a strong hit with a match, you can [[MV_Make a Discovery|Make a Discovery (move)]] as your character happens upon something wondrous. The match makes the outcome of your action more dramatic.

If your move and assets don’t provide a specific result for a match, you can still use it as a prompt to make something interesting happen. In solo and co-op modes, a match is your trigger to add a twist, create a new complication, introduce a new peril, or otherwise mix things up. If you’re playing as the guide, a match on the challenge dice can be your cue to introduce a surprising turn of events for the players.

You can let the outcome of an action influence the nature of a match. #missingArt
- ![[outcome-strong-hit.svg|40]] **Strong hit:** The match should represent a twist in the narrative, something interesting, or a new opportunity.
- ![[outcome-miss.svg|40]] **Miss:** The match should represent a heightened negative outcome, a complication, or new peril. Things get worse in an unexpected way.

You can also let the intensity of the success or failure frame how you interpret a match. Rolling matched 10’s on your challenge dice should prompt you to introduce a harrowing turn of events or a dire failure. It’s as bad as things get.

> Not sure what a match means for the current situation? You can [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle (move)]], which is a move you use to ask questions or check for inspiration. If the oracle isn’t helpful, and you’re still stuck for an idea, don’t sweat it. Just move on. Matches are not mandates—they are just an opportunity to season your story with occasional dramatic turns.

## The Guide and The Dice
If you are playing as ==the guide==, you focus on moderating the session and responding to your player’s questions and actions. Since NPCs don’t make moves, you won’t need to make action rolls. However, you might want to have a pair of D10s available for oracle rolls.
