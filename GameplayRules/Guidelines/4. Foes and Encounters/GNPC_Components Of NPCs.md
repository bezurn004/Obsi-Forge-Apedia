# [[_GB_Index|Gameplay Rules]] - [[_GNPC_Foes-Encounters|Foes and Encounters]]: Components of NPCs
The NPCs in the following section include some broad details to help guide how they are represented in your story. You can also consider these elements when creating your own encounters.

## Challenge Rank
Sample NPCs have a single mechanical attribute, their rank, using the standard Starforged challenge hierarchy. These ranks are represented within the NPC descriptions as filled hexagons.

## Using NPC Ranks
When does the rank matter? Here’s some examples: 
- Use the rank as a gauge to help envision the relevant power and influence of an NPC.
- Use the rank to set the level of focus you’d like this NPC to have in your story. A troublesome NPC may have a brief and minor role. The introduction of an epic NPC may have huge impact in your campaign.
- Use the rank to frame your interactions, and whether those interactions are uncertain or risky. Talking your way past a troublesome guard might be simple enough to avoid triggering a move. A formidable guard is likely well-trained and cunning.
- Use the rank of an NPC when you [[MV_Make a Connection|Make a Connection]] with them. A higher ranked NPC will require more effort and focus as you work toward building a bond.
- When you [[MV_Enter the Fray|Enter The Fray]], use the rank of the foe as a factor when setting the challenge rank of your objectives.
- When you face physical harm or stress at the hands of an NPC, take their rank into account as you [[MV_Endure Harm|Endure Harm ]]  or [[MV_Endure Stress|Endure Stress]]. When unsure, you can consider troublesome foes as typically inflicting 1 harm or stress, dangerous and formidable foes as inflicting 2 harm or stress, and extreme or epic foes as inflicting 3 harm or stress. Adjust as appropriate to the scale, armament and, methods of the character. A truly titanic NPC is of an immeasurable rank in comparison to your puny character.

## Features
Features are the typical outward characteristics of an NPC. They are not universally true, especially among diverse societies and lifeforms, but can provide some common impressions as a starting point.

## Drives
Drives reflect the motivations and instincts of an NPC. For creatures, these are relatively simple: hunt, eat, defend territory. For intelligent beings, drives are their typical goals and beliefs, but do not represent the complex range of motivations you will encounter. Drives are a starting place, giving you the rough outline of a typical NPC to be fleshed out (or contradicted) appropriate to their role in the fiction.

## Tactics
Tactics provide a reference for how an NPC or an enemy vehicle might act in combat. These give you a sense of typical approaches and maneuvers, but do not represent the possibilities of a complex and dramatic combat scene. You should let NPC actions flow out of the fiction. What is the situation? What is their goal? What will add to the excitement and danger of this moment? Make it happen. When in doubt, [[MV_Ask the Oracle|Ask the Oracle]].

Your foes should do more than simply try to inflict harm. A fearsome roar or demoralizing boast might cause you to Endure Stress. Tactical maneuvers reduce your momentum. Fictional complications, unexpected abilities or weapons, the appearance of new foes, environmental dangers, threats against companions or allies, realizations that undermine your quest, will heighten the drama of the scene.

The [[OCL_Combat Action|Combat Action Oracle]] can help inspire an action for a foe in a fight. Roll on this table and interpret the result as appropriate to the nature of the NPC or vehicle. 

## Variants
Sample NPCs include one or more alternate forms, group identities, manned vehicles, or companions. These variants have their own challenge rank. You can also create your own variant of a sample NPC simply by envisioning their characteristics and adjusting the rank. For example, the cunning leader of a scrap bandit gang might be a formidable (instead of dangerous) foe.

## Quest Starter
All NPCs include a quest starter that can serve as inspiration for a trouble in your setting and a sworn vow. The human NPCs in the following section can also offer inspiration for your own character’s background or role, perhaps a life they left behind.
